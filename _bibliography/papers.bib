	abstract = {Epigenetic clocks quantify regular changes in DNA methylation that occur with age, or in relation to biomarkers of ageing, and are strong predictors of morbidity and mortality. Here, we assess whether measures of fetal nutrition and growth that predict adult chronic disease also predict accelerated biological ageing in young adulthood using a suite of commonly used epigenetic clocks. Data come from the Cebu Longitudinal Health and Nutrition Survey (CLHNS), a long-running cohort followed since birth in metropolitan Cebu, Philippines. Past work has shown that birth weight (BW) and the mother's arm fat during pregnancy (a measure of pregnancy energy status) relate inversely to health outcomes in the CLHNS but primarily in males. Genome-wide DNA methylation was assessed in whole blood using the Infinium EPIC array. Participants included males (n=895) and females (n=803) measured in 2005 (20.8-22.5 years). Clocks included the Hannum and Horvath clocks trained on chronological age, the DNAmPhenoAge and DNAmGrimAge clocks trained on clinical biomarkers, the Dunedin pace of ageing (DunedinPACE) clock trained on longitudinal changes in ageing biomarkers, and the DNAmTL clock trained on leukocyte telomere length. In males, lower BW predicted advanced biological ageing using the Hannum, DNAmPhenoAge, DunedinPoAm, and DNAmTL clocks. In contrast, BW did not predict any clock in female participants. Participants' mothers' pregnancy arm fat only predicted DNAmTL in males. These findings suggest that epigenetic clocks are a useful tool for gauging long-term outcomes predicted by fetal growth, and add to existing evidence in the CLHNS for sex differences in these relationships.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Consistent with evolutionarily theorized costs of reproduction (CoR), reproductive history in women is associated with life expectancy and susceptibility to certain cancers, autoimmune disorders and metabolic disease. Immunological changes originating during reproduction may help explain some of these relationships.
METHODOLOGY: To explore the potential role of the immune system in female CoR, we characterized leukocyte composition and regulatory processes using DNA methylation (DNAm) in a cross-sectional cohort of young (20-22 years old) women differing in reproductive status.
RESULTS: Compared to nulliparity, pregnancy was characterized by differential methylation at 828 sites, 96\% of which were hypomethylated and enriched for genes associated with T-cell activation, innate immunity, pre-eclampsia and neoplasia. Breastfeeding was associated with differential methylation at 1107 sites (71\% hypermethylated), enriched for genes involved in metabolism, immune self-recognition and neurogenesis. There were no significant differences in DNAm between nulliparous and parous women. However, compared to nullipara, pregnant women had lower proportions of B, CD4T, CD8T and natural killer (NK) cells, and higher proportions of granulocytes and monocytes. Monocyte counts were lower and NK counts higher among breastfeeding women, and remained so among parous women.
IMPLICATIONS: Our findings point to widespread differences in DNAm during pregnancy and lactation. These effects appear largely transient, but may accumulate with gravidity become detectable as women age. Nulliparous and parous women differed in leukocyte composition, consistent with more persistent effects of reproduction on cell type. These findings support transient (leukocyte DNAm) and persistent (cell composition) changes associated with reproduction in women, illuminating potential pathways contributing to CoR. Lay Summary: Evolutionary theory and epidemiology support costs of reproduction (CoR) to women's health that may involve changes in immune function. We report differences in immune cell composition and gene regulation during pregnancy and breastfeeding. While many of these differences appear transient, immune cell composition may remain, suggesting mechanisms for female CoR.},

	abstract = {The geroscience hypothesis proposes that therapy to slow or reverse molecular changes that occur with aging can delay or prevent multiple chronic diseases and extend healthy lifespan1-3. Caloric restriction (CR), defined as lessening caloric intake without depriving essential nutrients4, results in changes in molecular processes that have been associated with aging, including DNA methylation (DNAm)5-7, and is established to increase healthy lifespan in multiple species8,9. Here we report the results of a post hoc analysis of the influence of CR on DNAm measures of aging in blood samples from the Comprehensive Assessment of Long-term Effects of Reducing Intake of Energy (CALERIE) trial, a randomized controlled trial in which n = 220 adults without obesity were randomized to 25\% CR or ad libitum control diet for 2 yr (ref. 10). We found that CALERIE intervention slowed the pace of aging, as measured by the DunedinPACE DNAm algorithm, but did not lead to significant changes in biological age estimates measured by various DNAm clocks including PhenoAge and GrimAge. Treatment effect sizes were small. Nevertheless, modest slowing of the pace of aging can have profound effects on population health11-13. The finding that CR modified DunedinPACE in a randomized controlled trial supports the geroscience hypothesis, building on evidence from small and uncontrolled studies14-16 and contrasting with reports that biological aging may not be modifiable17. Ultimately, a conclusive test of the geroscience hypothesis will require trials with long-term follow-up to establish effects of intervention on primary healthy-aging endpoints, including incidence of chronic disease and mortality18-20.},

We conducted proof-of-concept testing of 8 DNA-methylation (DNAm) and blood-chemistry quantifications of biological aging as mediators of disparities in healthspan between Black and White participants in the 2016 wave of the Health and Retirement Study (n = 9,005). We quantified biological aging from 4 DNAm "clocks" (Horvath, Hannum, PhenoAge, and GrimAge clock), a DNAm pace-of-aging measure (DunedinPoAm), and 3 blood-chemistry measures (PhenoAge, Klemera-Doubal method biological age, and homeostatic dysregulation). We quantified Black-White disparities in healthspan from cross-sectional and longitudinal data on physical performance tests, self-reported limitations in activities of daily living, and physician-diagnosed chronic diseases, self-rated health, and survival. DNAm and blood-chemistry quantifications of biological aging were moderately correlated (Pearson's r = 0.1-0.4). The GrimAge clock, DunedinPoAm, and all 3 blood-chemistry measures were associated with healthspan characteristics (e.g., mortality effect-size hazard ratios were 1.71-2.32 per standard deviation of biological aging) and showed evidence of more advanced/faster biological aging in Black participants than in White participants (Cohen's d = 0.4-0.5). These measures accounted for 13\%-95\% of Black-White differences in healthspan-related characteristics. Findings suggest that reducing disparities in biological aging can contribute to building health equity.},

	abstract = {Importance: People who complete more education live longer lives with better health. New evidence suggests that these benefits operate through a slowed pace of biological aging. If so, measurements of the pace biological aging could offer intermediate endpoints for studies of how interventions to promote education will impact healthy longevity. Objective: To test the hypothesis that upward educational mobility contributes to a slower pace of biological aging and increased longevity. Design: Prospective cohort study. Setting: We analyzed data from three generations of participants in the Framingham Heart Study: the Original cohort, enrolled beginning in 1948, the Offspring cohort, enrolled beginning in 1971, and the Gen3 cohort, enrolled beginning in 2002. Follow-up is on-going. Data analysis was conducted during 2022-2023 using data obtained from dbGaP (phs000007.v33). Participants: We constructed a three-generation database to quantify intergenerational educational mobility. We linked mobility data with blood DNA methylation data collected from the Offspring cohort in (2005-2008) (n=1,652) and the Gen3 cohort in 2009-2011 (n=1,449). These n=3,101 participants formed our analysis sample. Exposure: We measured educational mobility by comparing participants' educational outcomes with those of their parents. Outcomes: We measured the pace of biological aging from whole-blood DNA-methylation data using the DunedinPACE epigenetic clock. For comparison purposes, we repeated analysis using four other epigenetic clocks. Survival follow-up was conducted through 2019. Results: Participants who were upwardly mobile in educational terms tended to have slower DunedinPACE in later life (r=-0.18, 95\% CI [-0.23,-0.13], p{\textless}0.001). This pattern of association was similar across generations and held in within-family sibling comparisons. 402 Offspring-cohort participants died over the follow-up period. Upward educational mobility was associated with lower mortality risk (HR=0.89, 95\% CI [0.81,0.98] p=0.014). Slower DunedinPACE accounted for roughly half of this association. Conclusions and Relevance: Our findings support the hypothesis that interventions to promote educational attainment will slow the pace of biological aging and promote longevity. Epigenetic clocks, like DunedinPACE, have potential as near-term outcome measures of intervention effects on healthy aging. Experimental evidence is needed to confirm findings.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Childhood adversity has been linked to many indicators of shorter healthy lifespan, including earlier onset of disease and disability as well as early mortality. These observations suggest the hypothesis that childhood maltreatment may accelerate aging. OBJECTIVE: To characterize the relationship between childhood maltreatment and accelerated biological aging in a prospective cohort of 357 individuals with documented cases of childhood maltreatment and 250 controls matched on demographic and socioeconomic factors. METHODS: Cases were drawn from juvenile and adult court records from the years 1967 through 1971 in a large Midwest metropolitan geographic area. Cases were defined as having court-substantiated cases of childhood physical or sexual abuse, or neglect occurring at age 11 or younger. Controls were selected from the same schools and hospitals of birth and matched on age, sex, race, and approximate socioeconomic status. We compared biological aging in these two groups using two blood-chemistry algorithms, the Klemera-Doubal method Biological Age (KDM BA) and the PhenoAge. Algorithms were developed and validated in data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES) using published methods and publicly available software. RESULTS: Participants (55\% women, 49\% non-White) had mean age of 41 years (SD=4). Those with court substantiated childhood maltreatment history exhibited more advanced biological aging as compared with matched controls, although this difference was statistically different for only the KDM BA measure (KDM BA Cohen's D=0.20, 95\% CI=[0.03,0.36], p = 0.02; PhenoAge Cohen's D=0.09 95\% CI=[-0.08,0.25], p = 0.296). In subgroup analyses, maltreatment effect sizes were larger for women as compared to men and for White participants as compared to non-White participants, although these differences were not statistically significant at the α= 0.05 level. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: As of midlife, effects of childhood maltreatment on biological aging are small in magnitude but discernible. Interventions to treat psychological and behavioral sequelae of exposure to childhood maltreatment, including in midlife adults, have potential to protect survivors from excess burden of disease, disability, and mortality in later life.},

We tested associations of life-course social mobility with biological aging using data from participants in the 2016 Health and Retirement Study (HRS) Venous Blood Study who provided blood-chemistry (n = 9,255) and/or DNA methylation (DNAm) data (n = 3,976). We quantified social mobility from childhood to later-life using data on childhood family characteristics, educational attainment, and wealth accumulation. We quantified biological aging using 3 DNAm "clocks" and 3 blood-chemistry algorithms. We observed substantial social mobility among study participants. Those who achieved upward mobility exhibited less-advanced and slower biological aging. Associations of upward mobility with less-advanced and slower aging were consistent for blood-chemistry and DNAm measures of biological aging, and were similar for men and women and for Black and White Americans (Pearson-r effect-sizes ∼0.2 for blood-chemistry measures and the DNAm GrimAge clock and DunedinPoAm pace-of-aging measures; effect-sizes were smaller for the DNAm PhenoAge clock). Analysis restricted to educational mobility suggested differential effects by racial identity; mediating links between educational mobility and healthy aging may be disrupted by structural racism. In contrast, mobility producing accumulation of wealth appeared to benefit White and Black Americans equally, suggesting economic intervention to reduce wealth inequality may have potential to heal disparities in healthy aging.},

In the CALERIE study, 12\% CR for 2 years in healthy humans induced minor losses of muscle mass (leg lean mass) without changes of muscle strength, but mechanisms for muscle quality preservation remained unclear. We performed high-depth RNA-Seq (387-618 million paired reads) on human vastus lateralis muscle biopsies collected from the CALERIE participants at baseline, 12- and 24-month follow-up from the 90 CALERIE participants randomized to CR and "ad libitum" control. Using linear mixed effect model, we identified protein-coding genes and splicing variants whose expression was significantly changed in the CR group compared to controls, including genes related to proteostasis, circadian rhythm regulation, DNA repair, mitochondrial biogenesis, mRNA processing/splicing, FOXO3 metabolism, apoptosis, and inflammation. Changes in some of these biological pathways mediated part of the positive effect of CR on muscle quality. Differentially expressed splicing variants were associated with change in pathways shown to be affected by CR in model organisms. Two years of sustained CR in humans positively affected skeletal muscle quality, and impacted gene expression and splicing profiles of biological pathways affected by CR in model organisms, suggesting that attainable levels of CR in a lifestyle intervention can benefit muscle health in humans.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Exposure to famine in the prenatal period is associated with an increased risk of metabolic disease, including obesity and type 2 diabetes. We employed nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) metabolomic profiling to identify the metabolic changes that are associated with survival of prenatal famine exposure during the Dutch Famine at the end of World War II and subsequently assess their link to disease. METHODS: NMR metabolomics data were generated from serum in 480 individuals prenatally exposed to famine (mean 58.8 years, 0.5 SD) and 464 controls (mean 57.9 years, 5.4 SD). We tested associations of prenatal famine exposure with levels of 168 individual metabolic biomarkers and compared the metabolic biomarker signature of famine exposure with those of 154 common diseases. RESULTS: Prenatal famine exposure was associated with higher concentrations of branched-chain amino acids ((iso)-leucine), aromatic amino acid (tyrosine), and glucose in later life (0.2-0.3 SD, p {\textbackslash}textless 3 × 10-3). The metabolic biomarker signature of prenatal famine exposure was positively correlated to that of incident type 2 diabetes from the UK Biobank (r = 0.77, p = 3 × 10-27), also when re-estimating the signature of prenatal famine exposure among individuals without diabetes (r = 0.67, p = 1 × 10-18). Remarkably, this association extended to 115 common diseases for which signatures were available (0.3 ≤ r ≤ 0.9, p {\textbackslash}textless 3.2 × 10-4). Correlations among metabolic signatures of famine exposure and disease outcomes were attenuated when the famine signature was adjusted for body mass index. CONCLUSIONS: Prenatal famine exposure is associated with a metabolic biomarker signature that strongly resembles signatures of a diverse set of diseases, an observation that can in part be attributed to a shared involvement of obesity.},

            While observational studies and small pilot trials suggest that vitamin D, omega-3 and exercise may slow biological aging, larger clinical trials testing these treatments individually or in combination are lacking. Here, we report the results of a post hoc analysis among 777 participants of the DO-HEALTH trial on the effect of vitamin D (2,000 IU per day) and/or omega-3 (1 g per day) and/or a home exercise program on four next-generation DNA methylation (DNAm) measures of biological aging (PhenoAge, GrimAge, GrimAge2 and DunedinPACE) over 3 years. Omega-3 alone slowed the DNAm clocks PhenoAge, GrimAge2 and DunedinPACE, and all three treatments had additive benefits on PhenoAge. Overall, from baseline to year 3, standardized effects ranged from 0.16 to 0.32 units (2.9–3.8 months). In summary, our trial indicates a small protective effect of omega-3 treatment on slowing biological aging over 3 years across several clocks, with an additive protective effect of omega-3, vitamin D and exercise based on PhenoAge.},

Intrinsic health is a quantifiable property of individuals that declines with age and interacts with context.

The concordance between the two EPIC versions in DNA methylation–based tools has not yet been investigated. To address this, DNA methylation was profiled on both versions using matched blood samples across four cohorts spanning early to late adulthood. High concordance between versions at the array level but variable agreement at the individual probe level was noted. A significant contribution of the EPIC version to DNA methylation variation was observed, though it was to a smaller extent compared with sample relatedness and cell-type composition. Modest but significant differences in DNA methylation–based estimates between versions were observed, irrespective of the data preprocessing method used. Adjustments for EPIC version or calculation of estimates separately for each version largely mitigated these version-specific discordances. This work emphasizes the importance of accounting for EPIC version differences in research scenarios, especially in meta-analyses and longitudinal studies that require data harmonization across versions.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Aging is the leading risk factor for most chronic disease. However, disease risk varies substantially between individuals of the same age. Biological aging measures attempt to quantify this difference using biomarkers; such measures have amassed substantial evidence as reliable correlates of morbidity and mortality. Although many have been developed throughout the years, there is no clear consensus as to which one is the best, if any. This study evaluates four methods for measuring biological aging: Klemera and Doubal's method for biological age (KDM BA), phenotypic age (PA), homeostatic dysregulation (DM), and Pace of Aging (Pace). Using five cohort studies from four different countries (InCHIANTI from Italy, WHAS I and II from the United States, NuAge from Canada, and the UK Biobank), we assessed the relationship of these metrics with six health outcomes. The metrics were calculated using a consistent set of biomarkers to facilitate comparison. The biological aging measures correlated only weakly with each other (r {\textgreater} .5 for six of 21 correlations). The meta-analyses performed on the results from each dataset revealed that all biological age measures were significantly associated with at least one health outcome; however, no single metric consistently outperformed the others, with strength of association strikingly similar across metrics. This study is the first to combine an international multicohort analysis using a consistent set of biomarkers across biological age metrics. While there are no net winners or losers, effect sizes are heterogeneous across cohorts, highlighting the importance of replicating findings in different contexts and with different metrics.},

Healthy lifestyle behaviors are proposed as a key strategy to promote healthy aging. However, the potential of lifestyle interventions to address aging health disparities is uncertain. We analyzed data from 42 625 adult participants (aged 20-85 years) participating in National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), 1999-2018 to evaluate relationships among healthy lifestyle behaviors and biological aging across White, Black, and Hispanic-identifying groups. We measured healthy lifestyle as adherence to a Mediterranean diet and level of leisure-time physical activity using established methods. We measured healthy aging using the PhenoAge biological age algorithm applied to blood chemistry data. We tested associations within each race/ethnic identity group and compared associations across groups using regression models with interaction terms. We found that within each race/ethnic identity group, greater adherence to a Mediterranean diet and higher levels of leisure-time physical activity were associated with younger biological age, independent of demographic and socioeconomic confounders, obesity, and smoking. However, these associations were stronger among White- as compared to non-Hispanic Black- and Hispanic-identifying adults. Results suggest that healthy lifestyle factors are likely to promote healthy aging across the population. However, lifestyle factors alone may not be sufficient to completely address race/ethnic disparities in healthy aging. Future studies will need to investigate additional ways to reduce racial and ethnic disparities in healthy aging.},

	abstract = {Leveraging clinical phenotypes1,2, neuroimaging3, proteomics4, metabolomics5, and epigenetics6, biological aging clocks across organ systems and tissues have advanced our understanding of human aging and disease. In this study, we expand this biological aging clock framework to multi-organ magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) by developing 7 organ-specific MRI-based biological age gaps (MRIBAGs), including the brain, heart, liver, adipose tissue, spleen, kidney, and pancreas. Leveraging imaging, genetic, proteomic, and metabolomic data from 313,645 individuals curated by the MULTI consortium, we link the 7 MRIBAGs to 2,923 plasma proteins, 327 metabolites, and 6,477,810 common genetic variants. These associations reveal organ-specific and cross-organ interconnection landscapes, identifying distinct molecular signatures related to organ aging. Genome-wide associations identify 53 MRIBAG-locus pairs (P{\textless}5×10D8). Genetic correlation and Mendelian randomization analyses further support organ-specific and cross-organ interconnections with 9 phenotype-based1,2, 11 proteome-based7, and 5 metabolome-based aging clocks5, as well as 525 disease endpoints. Through functional gene mapping and Bayesian colocalization analysis linking evidence from genetics, proteomics, and metabolomics, we prioritize 9 druggable genes as targets for future anti-aging treatments. Finally, we demonstrate the clinical relevance of the 7 MRIBAGs in predicting disease endpoints (e.g., diabetes mellitus), all-cause mortality, and capturing differential and heterogeneous cognitive decline trajectories over 240 weeks of treatment with the Alzheimer’s disease drug (Solanezumab). Sex differences are evident across multiple organ systems, manifesting at structural, molecular, and genetic levels. In summary, we developed 7 MRI-based aging clocks that enhance the existing multi-organ biological aging framework, offer multi-scale insights into aging biology, and demonstrate clinical potential to advance future aging research.},

	abstract = {Background: Racial discrimination experiences are associated with the activation of stress biology pathways and signs of accelerated biological aging, including alterations in DNA methylation (DNAm). Coping strategies may mitigate stress from racial discrimination and protect against long-term adverse health outcomes. Methods: We conducted a secondary analysis of data from the Intergenerational Impact of Genetic and Psychological Factors on Blood Pressure cohort, an all-African-American sample, to test the hypothesis that social support can protect against accelerated biological aging associated with experiences of racial discrimination. We measured biological aging from saliva DNAm using six epigenetic clocks. Clock values were residualized on participant age and the estimated proportion of epithelial cells contributing to the DNA sample and standardized to M = 0, SD = 1 within the analysis sample. The primary analysis was focused on the second-generation PhenoAge and GrimAge clocks and the third-generation DunedinPACE "speedometer," which previous studies have linked with racial discrimination. Results: In our sample (n = 234; mean age = 31.9 years; SD = 5.80), we found evidence consistent with our hypothesis in the case of the PhenoAge clock, but not the other clocks. Among mothers who did not seek social support, experiences of racial discrimination were associated with an older PhenoAge (b = 0.26, 95\% CI = 0.02-0.50, p = 0.03). However, social-support seeking mitigated this risk; at the highest levels of social support, no adverse consequences of discrimination were observed (interaction b = -0.01, 95\% CI = -0.02--0.00, p = 0.03). Conclusions: The replication of results is needed. Future research should also investigate additional adaptive and maladaptive coping strategies utilized by African American women and mothers to identify protective measures that influence health outcomes.},

Structural racism directs adverse policing to differentially patrol groups racialized as Black increasing the chances of incarceration, leading to disproportionate representation in prisons. Direct and indirect exposure to incarceration produces chronic stress and trauma for adults racialized as Black. Due to the unique expansion of U.S. prisons after the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, we examined the association between the 10-year average racialized disparity in prison population for the decade succeeding the Crime Bill, 1995-2005, with the overall 14-year cognitive test performance for older adults racialized as Black living in the same county between 2006 and 2020. This observational study linked the average county-level racialized disparity in U.S. prisons to biannual cognitive performance interviews for mid-to-late life adults racialized as Black ({\textgreater} 50 years; N = 1784) from the Health and Retirement Study using baseline county of residence. Cognitive performance was assessed using a 27-item global cognitive score from the modified Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status administered in-person or online. Mixed-effects regressions estimated that greater incarceration of people racialized as Black in prisons was associated with lower overall cognitive test performance among participants racialized as Black (mean difference per 1000 more incarcerated people per 1000 population racialized as Black vs White = - 0.172, 95\% CI = - 0.331, - 0.014). As artist Marvin Gaye sang in his song Flyin' High (in the Friendly Sky), "I go to the place where danger waits me," which describes how structural racism via incarceration disparities occurring in one's surroundings increases cognitive health for people racialized as Black irrespective of population size.},

METHODS We analyzed Framingham Heart Study Offspring Cohort data (n = 2296; 46\% male; baseline age M = 62, SD = 9, range = 25–101 y). We measured cognitive decline across two decades of neuropsychological-testing follow-up. We measured pace of aging using the DunedinPACE epigenetic clock. Analysis tested if participants with faster DunedinPACE values experienced more rapid cognitive decline compared with those with slower DunedinPACE values. RESULTS Participants with faster DunedinPACE had poorer cognitive functioning at baseline and experienced more rapid cognitive decline over follow-up. Results were robust to confounders and consistent across population strata. Findings were similar for the PhenoAge and GrimAge epigenetic clocks. DISCUSSION Faster pace of aging is a risk factor for preclinical cognitive decline. Metrics of biological aging may inform risk stratification in clinical trials and prognosis in patient care. Highlights Faster DunedinPACE is associated with preclinical cognitive aging. Higher baseline cognition was protective of DunedinPACE-associated cognitive decline. The DunedinPACE association with cognitive decline explained a fourth of dementia risk.},

	abstract = {People who complete more education live longer lives with better health. New evidence suggests that these benefits operate through a slowed pace of biological aging. If so, measurements of the pace of biological aging could offer intermediate end points for studies of how interventions to promote education will affect healthy longevity.To test the hypothesis that upward educational mobility is associated with a slower pace of biological aging and increased longevity.This prospective cohort study analyzed data from 3 generations of participants in the Framingham Heart Study: (1) the original cohort, enrolled beginning in 1948; (2) the Offspring cohort, enrolled beginning in 1971; and (3) the Gen3 cohort, enrolled beginning in 2002. A 3-generation database was constructed to quantify intergenerational educational mobility. Mobility data were linked with blood DNA-methylation data collected from the Offspring cohort in 2005 to 2008 (n = 1652) and the Gen3 cohort in 2009 to 2011 (n = 1449). Follow-up is ongoing. Data analysis was conducted from June 2022 to November 2023 using data obtained from the National Institutes of Health database of Genotypes and Phenotypes (dbGaP).Educational mobility was measured by comparing participants’ educational outcomes with those of their parents.The pace of biological aging was measured from whole-blood DNA-methylation data using the DunedinPACE epigenetic clock. For comparison purposes, the analysis was repeated using 4 other epigenetic clocks. Survival follow-up was conducted through 2019.This study analyzed data from 3101 participants from the Framingham Heart Study; 1652 were in the Offspring cohort (mean [SD] age, 65.57 [9.22] years; 764 [46.2\%] male) and 1449 were in the Gen3 cohort (mean [SD] age, 45.38 [7.83] years; 691 [47.7\%] male). Participants who were upwardly mobile in educational terms tended to have slower pace of aging in later life (r = −0.18 [95\% CI, −0.23 to −0.13]; P \&lt; .001). This pattern of association was similar across generations and held in within-family sibling comparisons. There were 402 Offspring cohort participants who died over the follow-up period. Upward educational mobility was associated with lower mortality risk (hazard ratio, 0.89 [95\% CI, 0.81 to 0.98]; P = .01). Slower pace of aging accounted for approximately half of this association.This cohort study’s findings support the hypothesis that interventions to promote educational attainment may slow the pace of biological aging and promote longevity. Epigenetic clocks have potential as near-term outcome measures of intervention effects on healthy aging. Experimental evidence is needed to confirm findings.},

	abstract = {Natural-experiment designs that compare survivors of in utero famine exposure to unaffected controls suggest that in utero undernutrition predisposes to development of obesity. However, birth rates drop dramatically during famines. Selection bias could arise if factors that contribute to obesity also protect fertility and/or fetal survival under famine conditions. We investigated this hypothesis using genetic analysis of a famine-exposed birth cohort. We genotyped participants in the Dutch Hunger Winter Families Study (DHWFS, n = 950; 45\% male), of whom 51\% were exposed to the 1944-1945 Dutch Famine during gestation, and 49\% were their unexposed same-sex siblings or “time controls” born before or after the famine in the same hospitals. We computed body mass index (BMI) polygenic indices (PGIs) in DHWFS participants and compared BMI PGIs between famine-exposed and control groups. Participants with higher polygenic risk had higher BMIs (Pearson r = 0.42, P \&lt; .001). However, differences between BMI PGIs of famine-exposed participants and controls were small and not statistically different from 0 across specifications (Cohen’s d = 0.10, P \&gt; .092). Our findings did not indicate selection bias, supporting the validity of the natural-experiment design within DHWFS. In summary, our study outlines a novel approach to explore the presence of selection bias in famine and other natural experiment studies.},

	abstract = {Objective People who eat healthier diets are less likely to develop dementia, but the biological mechanism of this protection is not well understood. We tested the hypothesis that healthy diet protects against dementia because it slows the pace of biological aging. Methods We analyzed Framingham Offspring Cohort data. We included participants ≥60 years-old, free of dementia and having dietary, epigenetic, and follow-up data. We assessed healthy diet as long-term adherence to the Mediterranean-Dash Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay diet (MIND, over 4 visits spanning 1991–2008). We measured the pace of aging from blood DNA methylation data collected in 2005–2008 using the DunedinPACE epigenetic clock. Incident dementia and mortality were defined using study records compiled from 2005 to 2008 visit through 2018. Results Of n = 1,644 included participants (mean age 69.6, 54\% female), n = 140 developed dementia and n = 471 died over 14 years of follow-up. Greater MIND score was associated with slower DunedinPACE and reduced risks for dementia and mortality. Slower DunedinPACE was associated with reduced risks for dementia and mortality. In mediation analysis, slower DunedinPACE accounted for 27\% of the diet-dementia association and 57\% of the diet-mortality association. Interpretation Findings suggest that slower pace of aging mediates part of the relationship of healthy diet with reduced dementia risk. Monitoring pace of aging may inform dementia prevention. However, a large fraction of the diet-dementia association remains unexplained and may reflect direct connections between diet and brain aging that do not overlap other organ systems. Investigation of brain-specific mechanisms in well-designed mediation studies is warranted. ANN NEUROL 2024;95:1069–1079},

The ALSPAC study recruited 14 541 women who gave birth in the Avon Health District in the UK between April 1, 1991, and December 31, 1992. The ARIES substudy comprised 1018 mother-offspring dyads based on the availability of DNA samples profiled in 2014. Epigenetic age was estimated using DNA methylation-based epigenetic clocks (including Horvath, Hannum, GrimAge, PhenoAge, and DunedinPACE) in mothers during pregnancy and the Knight and Bohlin cord blood epigenetic clocks in newborns. Analyses were performed between October 1, 2022, and November 30, 2023.A composite measure of maternal ACEs was the primary exposure in both maternal and offspring models; as a secondary analysis, individual ACEs were measured separately. The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) was used to investigate depression during pregnancy as an exposure.Changes in epigenetic age acceleration (EAA) were investigated as the primary outcome in maternal models during pregnancy. Changes in epigenetic gestational age acceleration (GAA) were the primary outcome in offspring analyses. Linear regression analyses were used to determine the association between maternal ACEs and both outcomes.This study included 883 mother-child dyads. The mean (SD) maternal age at delivery was 29.8 (4.3) years. Pregnant women with higher ACE scores exhibited higher GrimAge EAA (β, 0.22 [95\% CI, 0.12 to 0.33] years; P \&lt; .001). Maternal ACEs were not associated with GAA in newborns using P \&lt; .05 as a cutoff to determine statistical significance. Depression was associated with higher GrimAge EAA (β, 0.06 [95\% CI, 0.02 to 0.10] years; P = .01) in mothers during pregnancy, but not in newborns, and did not mediate the association between ACEs and EAA.The findings of this study suggest that maternal ACEs may be associated with epigenetic aging later in life, including during pregnancy, supporting a role for maternal ACEs in offspring development and health later in life.},

This study investigated the hypothesis that discrimination contributes to poor health outcomes by accelerating biological processes of aging. We analyzed survey and blood DNA methylation data from the Midlife in the United States (MIDUS) study (N = 1967). We used linear regression analysis to test associations of everyday, major, and workplace discrimination with biological aging measured by the DunedinPACE, PhenoAge, and GrimAge2 epigenetic clocks. MIDUS participants who reported more discrimination tended to exhibit a faster pace of aging and older biological age as compared to peers who reported less discrimination. Effect-sizes for associations tended to be larger for the DunedinPACE pace-of-aging clock (effect-size range r = 0.1–0.2) as compared with the PhenoAge and GrimAge2 biological-age clocks (effect-sizes r {\textless} 0.1) and for experiences of everyday and major discrimination as compared with workplace discrimination. Smoking status and body-mass index accounted for roughly half of observed association between discrimination and biological aging. Reports of discrimination were more strongly associated with accelerated biological aging among White as compared with Black participants, although Black participants reported more discrimination overall and tended to exhibit older biological age and faster biological aging. Findings support the hypothesis that experiences of interpersonal discrimination contribute to accelerated biological aging and suggest that structural and individual-level interventions to reduce discrimination and promote adaptive coping have potential to support healthy aging and build health equity.},

	abstract = {Background
Childhood maltreatment and psychiatric morbidity have each been associated with accelerated biological aging primarily through cross-sectional studies. Using data from a prospective longitudinal study of individuals with histories of childhood maltreatment and control participants followed into midlife, we tested 2 hypotheses examining whether 1) psychiatric symptoms mediate the relationship between childhood maltreatment and biological aging and 2) psychiatric symptoms of anxiety, depression, or posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) act in conjunction with childhood maltreatment to exacerbate the association of child maltreatment to aging.
Methods
Children (ages 0–11 years) with documented histories of maltreatment and demographically matched control children were followed into adulthood (N = 607) and interviewed over several waves of the study. Depression, anxiety, and PTSD symptoms were assessed at mean ages of 29 (interview 1) and 40 (interview 2) years. Biological age was measured from blood chemistries collected later (mean age = 41 years) using the Klemera-Doubal method. Hypotheses were tested using linear regressions and path analyses.
Results
Adults with documented histories of childhood maltreatment showed more symptoms of depression, PTSD, and anxiety at both interviews and more advanced biological aging, compared with control participants. PTSD symptoms at both interviews and depression and anxiety symptoms only at interview 2 predicted accelerated biological aging. There was no evidence of mediation; however, anxiety and depression moderated the relationship between childhood maltreatment and biological aging.
Conclusions
These new findings reveal the shorter- and longer-term longitudinal impact of PTSD on biological aging and the amplifying effect of anxiety and depression on the relationship between child maltreatment and biological aging.},

When parents’ genetics affect their children’s environments, these two modes of inheritance can produce an ‘indirect genetic effect’. Such indirect genetic effects may account for up to half of the estimated genetic variance in educational attainment. Here we tested if indirect genetic effects reflect within-nuclear-family transmission (‘genetic nurture’) or instead a multi-generational process of social stratification (‘dynastic effects’). We analysed indirect genetic effects on children’s academic achievement in their fifth to ninth years of schooling in N = 37,117 parent–offspring trios in the Norwegian Mother, Father, and Child Cohort Study (MoBa). We used pairs of genetically related families (parents were siblings, children were cousins; N = 10,913) to distinguish within-nuclear-family genetic-nurture effects from dynastic effects shared by cousins in different nuclear families. We found that indirect genetic effects on children’s academic achievement cannot be explained by processes that operate exclusively within the nuclear family.},

We also tested four additional epigenetic measures of aging: the Horvath clock, the Hannum clock, PhenoAge, and GrimAge. Across all datasets (total N observations=3380; total N individuals=2322), faster DunedinPACE was associated with lower total brain volume, lower hippocampal volume, greater burden of white matter microlesions, and thinner cortex. Across all measures, DunedinPACE and GrimAge had the strongest and most consistent associations with brain phenotypes.

The Comprehensive Assessment of Long-Term Effects of Reducing Intake of Energy (CALERIE™) 2 trial tested translation of these findings to humans. CALERIE™ randomized healthy, nonobese men and premenopausal women (age 21-50y; BMI 22.0-27.9 kg/m2), to 25\% CR or ad-libitum (AL) control (2:1) for 2 years. Prior analyses of CALERIE™ participants' blood chemistries, immunology, and epigenetic data suggest the 2-year CR intervention slowed biological aging. Here, we extend these analyses to test effects of CR on telomere length (TL) attrition. TL was quantified in blood samples collected at baseline, 12-, and 24-months by quantitative PCR (absolute TL; aTL) and a published DNA-methylation algorithm (DNAmTL). Intent-to-treat analysis found no significant differences in TL attrition across the first year, although there were trends toward increased attrition in the CR group for both aTL and DNAmTL measurements. When accounting for adherence heterogeneity with an Effect-of-Treatment-on-the-Treated analysis, greater CR dose was associated with increased DNAmTL attrition during the baseline to 12-month weight-loss period. By contrast, both CR group status and increased CR were associated with reduced aTL attrition over the month 12 to month 24 weight maintenance period. No differences were observed when considering TL change across the study duration from baseline to 24-months, leaving it unclear whether CR-related effects reflect long-term detriments to telomere fidelity, a hormesis-like adaptation to decreased energy availability, or measurement error and insufficient statistical power. Unraveling these trends will be a focus of future CALERIE™ analyses and trials.},

	abstract = {A central prediction of evolutionary theory is that energy invested into reproduction comes at the expense of somatic maintenance and repair, accelerating biological aging. Supporting this prediction are findings that high fertility among women predicts shorter lifespan and poorer health later in life. However, biological aging is thought to begin before age-related health declines, limiting the applicability of morbidity and mortality for studying the aging process earlier in life. Here, we examine the relationship between reproductive history and biological aging in a sample of young (20 to 22yo) men and women from the Cebu Longitudinal Health and Nutrition Survey, located in the Philippines (n = 1,735). We quantify biological aging using six measures, collectively known as epigenetic clocks, reflecting various facets of cellular aging, health, and mortality risk. In a subset of women, we test whether longitudinal changes in gravidity between young and early-middle adulthood (25 to 31yo) are associated with changes in epigenetic aging during that time. Cross-sectionally, gravidity was associated with all six measures of accelerated epigenetic aging in women (n = 825). Furthermore, longitudinal increases in gravidity were linked to accelerated epigenetic aging in two epigenetic clocks (n = 331). In contrast, the number of pregnancies a man reported fathering was not associated with epigenetic aging among same-aged cohort men (n = 910). These effects were robust to socioecological, environmental, and immunological factors, consistent with the hypothesis that pregnancy accelerates biological aging and that these effects can be detected in young women in a high-fertility context.},

              The link between familial loss of a loved one and long-term health decline is complex and not fully understood.
            
            
              Objective
              To test associations of losing a parent, sibling, child, or partner or spouse with accelerated biological aging.
            
            
              Design, Setting, and Participants
              Data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health, a US population-based longitudinal cohort study, were analyzed. Participants were enrolled from 1994 to 1995 for wave 1, while in grades 7 to 12, and followed up through wave 5 in 2018. The study analyzed participant reports of loss collected at each wave from 1 to 5 over 24 years and used a banked wave 5 blood sample for subsequent DNA methylation testing and epigenetic clock calculation from 2018 to 2024. Data were analyzed from January 2022 to July 2024.
            
            
              Exposure
              Loss of biological parents or parental figures, partners or spouses, siblings, or children at waves 1 to 3 or during childhood, adolescence (aged \&amp;lt;18 years), or adulthood at wave 4 to wave 5 (aged 18-43 years).
            
            
              Main Outcomes and Measures
              Biological aging assessed from blood DNA methylation using the Horvath, PhenoAge, GrimAge, and DunedinPACE epigenetic clocks at wave 5.
            
            
              Results
              Data from 3963 participants were analyzed, with a weighted mean (range) age of 38.36 (36.78-39.78) years at wave 5; 2370 (50.3\%) were male, 720 (15.97\%) were Black, 400 (8.18\%) were Hispanic, and 2642 (72.53\%) were White. Nearly 40\% of participants experienced loss by wave 5 when they were aged 33 to 43 years, and participants who were Black (379 participants [56.67\%]), Hispanic (152 participants [41.38\%]), and American Indian (18 participants [56.08\%]) experienced a greater proportion of losses compared with White participants (884 participants [34.09\%]). Those who experienced 2 or more losses tended to have older biological ages for several of the clocks (PhenoAge β = 0.15; 95\% CI, 0.02 to 0.28; GrimAge β = 0.27; 95\% CI, 0.09 to 0.45; DunedinPACE β = 0.22; 95\% CI, 0.10 to 0.34) compared with those with no losses. In contrast, there were no associations with 2 or more losses for the Horvath clock (β = −0.08; 95\% CI, −0.23 to 0.06).
            
            
              Conclusions and Relevance
              This study reveals associations between various measures of loss experienced from childhood to adulthood and biological aging in a diverse sample of the US population. These findings underscore the potentially enduring impact of loss on biological aging even before middle age and may contribute to understanding racial and ethnic disparities in health and mortality.},

	doi = {10.1111/jgs.18726},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Elevated psychosocial stress has been linked with accelerated biological aging, including composite DNA methylation (DNAm) markers that predict aging-related outcomes ("epigenetic age"). However, no study has examined whether stressful life events (SLEs) are associated with epigenetic age acceleration in postmenopausal women, an aging population characterized by increased stress burden and disease risk.
METHODS: We leveraged the Women's Health Initiative, a large muti-ancestry cohort of postmenopausal women with available psychosocial stress measures over the past year and epigenomic data. SLEs and social support were ascertained via self-report questionnaires. Whole blood DNAm array (450 K) data were used to calculate five DNAm-based predictors of chronological age, health span and life span, and telomere length (HorvathAge, HannumAge, PhenoAge, GrimAge, DNAmTL).
RESULTS: After controlling for potential confounders, higher SLE burden was significantly associated with accelerated epigenetic aging, as measured by GrimAge (β: 0.34, 95\% CI: 0.08, 0.59) and DNAmTL (β: -0.016, 95\% CI: -0.028, -0.004). Exploratory analyses showed that SLEs-GrimAge associations were stronger in Black women as compared to other races/ethnicities and in those with lower social support levels. In women with lower social support, SLEs-DNAmTL associations showed opposite association in Hispanic women as compared to other race/ethnicity groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that elevated stress burden is associated with accelerated epigenetic aging in postmenopausal women. Lower social support and/or self-reported race/ethnicity may modify the association of stress with epigenetic age acceleration. These findings advance understanding of how stress may contribute to aging-related outcomes and have important implications for disease prevention and treatment in aging women.},

	abstract = {The association between ultra-processed food (UPF) intake and markers of biological ageing has been scarcely investigated, despite the evident adverse health effects associated with UPF. This study aimed to test the association between UPF intake and biological ageing, and evaluate how much of this association is accounted for by overall diet quality.This cross-sectional study assessed 16 055 participants aged 20–79 years (51\% women, 46 ± 0.3 years) from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2003–2010. Dietary UPF intake was assessed using the Nova system. Values were expressed as \% of total energy intake and were denominated as a continuous variable and in quintiles. Diet quality was assessed with the American Heart Association 2020 and the Healthy Eating Index 2015. Biological ageing was assessed using the PhenoAge algorithm.For each 10\% of energy intake accounted for by UPF, participants were 0.21 (95\%CI 0.16–0.26) years biologically older in terms of PhenoAge. As compared to participants in the lowest UPF quintile (≤39\%), those in the highest UPF quintile (68–100\%) were 0.86 (95\% CI 0.55, 1.16) years older (P-for-trend across quintiles ≤0.001). Adherence to a healthy diet moderately attenuated the relationship between UPF and PhenoAge (adjusted β = 0.14 per 10\% increment of UPF).Adults with higher UPF tended to be biologically older. This association is partly independent of diet quality, suggesting that food processing may contribute to biological ageing acceleration. Our findings point to a compelling reason to target UPF consumption to promote healthier ageing.},

	abstract = {An intriguing effect of short-term caloric restriction (CR) is the expansion of certain stem cell populations, including muscle stem cells (satellite cells), which facilitate an accelerated regenerative program after injury. Here, we utilized the MetRSL274G (MetRS) transgenic mouse to identify liver-secreted plasminogen as a candidate for regulating satellite cell expansion during short-term CR. Knockdown of circulating plasminogen prevents satellite cell expansion during short-term CR. Furthermore, loss of the plasminogen receptor KT (Plg-RKT) is also sufficient to prevent CR-related satellite cell expansion, consistent with direct signaling of plasminogen through the plasminogen receptor Plg-RKT/ERK kinase to promote proliferation of satellite cells. Importantly, we are able to replicate many of these findings in human participants from the CALERIE trial. Our results demonstrate that CR enhances liver protein secretion of plasminogen, which signals directly to the muscle satellite cell through Plg-RKT to promote proliferation and subsequent muscle resilience during CR.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Household economic adversity during adolescence is hypothesized to be a risk factor for poor mental health later in life. To test this hypothesis, we conducted a quasi-experimental analysis of an economic shock, the Great Recession of 2007-2009. We tested if going through adolescence during the Great Recession was associated with increased risk of major depressive episodes (MDE) and mental health treatment in young adulthood with potential moderation by household poverty to explore differences by economic adversity.
METHODS: We analyzed data on young adults age 18-29 years from the 2005-2019 National Survey on Drug Use and Health (N = 145,394). We compared participants who were adolescents during the recession to those followed-up prior to the recession. Regression analysis tested effect modification by household poverty status.
RESULTS: Adolescent exposure to the Great Recession was associated with higher likelihood of MDE during young adulthood (aOR = 1.30, 95\% CI = 1.23, 1.37); there was no relationship with mental health treatment. Effects on MDE were stronger among those in households with higher incomes compared to those living in poverty.
CONCLUSION: Findings support the hypothesis that exposure to the Great Recession during adolescence may have increased risk for MDE, but raise questions about whether the mechanism of this association is economic distress.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: The aim of this literature review is to examine evidence of time trends and birth cohort effects in depressive disorders and symptoms among US adolescents in peer-reviewed articles from January 2004 to April 2022.
METHODS: We conducted an integrative systematic literature review. Three reviewers participated at different stages of article review. Of the 2234 articles identified in three databases (Pubmed, ProQuest Central, Ebscohost), 10 met inclusion criteria (i.e., adolescent aged United States populations, included information about birth cohort and survey year, focused on depressive symptoms/disorders).
RESULTS: All 10 articles observed increases in depressive symptoms and disorders in adolescents across recent survey years with increases observed between 1991 and 2020. Of the 3 articles that assessed birth cohort trends, birth cohort trends were less prominent than time period trends. Proposed explanations for increases included social media, economic-related reasons, changes in mental health screening and diagnosis, declining mental health stigma, increased treatment, and, in more recent years, the COVID-19 pandemic.
CONCLUSIONS: Multiple cross-sectional surveys and cohort studies documented rising prevalence of depressive symptoms and disorder among adolescents from 1991 to 2020. Mechanisms driving this increase are still unknown. Research to identify these mechanisms is needed to inform depression screening and intervention efforts for adolescents.},

OBJECTIVE: This article describes the Add Health Parent Study (AHPS) Phase 2, a study of social, behavioral, and biological factors influencing healthy aging and risk for AD/ADRD, in a national sample of adults aged 58-90.
METHODS: Sample members are parents of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health) cohort, initially interviewed in Add Health in midlife (1994-95). AHPS Phase 1 (2015-17) collected longitudinal data on a random subsample of parents and their spouse/partners, who were mostly Non-Hispanic (NH) White. AHPS Phase 2 will collect the same longitudinal socio-behavioral, and health survey data on all remaining NH Black and Hispanic parents (Black and Hispanic Supplement, BHS). Additionally, Phase 2 will collect cognitive and DNA data from AHPS Phase 1 and BHS sample parents and their current spouse/partners.
RESULTS: Funded by the National Institute on Aging, recruitment will occur between June 2025 and May 2026, producing an expected total AHPS sample of 5506 parents and their spouse/partners.
CONCLUSIONS: The AHPS will be the first longitudinal cohort study powered to address multigenerational racial/ethnic disparities in AD/ADRD risk and protective factors across race/ethnic groups and socioeconomic strata.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Emerging evidence reveals a complex relationship between cardiovascular disease (CVD) and cancer, which share common risk factors and biological pathways.
OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to evaluate common epigenetic signatures for CVD and cancer incidence in 3 ethnically diverse cohorts: Native Americans from the SHS (Strong Heart Study), European Americans from the FHS (Framingham Heart Study), and European Americans and African Americans from the ARIC (Atherosclerosis Risk In Communities) study.
METHODS: A 2-stage strategy was used that included first conducting untargeted epigenome-wide association studies for each cohort and then running targeted models in the union set of identified differentially methylated positions (DMPs). We also explored potential molecular pathways by conducting a bioinformatics analysis.
RESULTS: Common DMPs were identified across all populations. In a subsequent meta-analysis, 3 and 1 of those DMPs were statistically significant for CVD only and both cancer and CVD, respectively. No meta-analyzed DMPs were statistically significant for cancer only. The enrichment analysis pointed to interconnected biological pathways involved in cancer and CVD. In the DrugBank database, elements related to 1-carbon metabolism and cancer and CVD medications were identified as potential drugs for target gene products. In an additional analysis restricted to the 950 SHS participants who developed incident CVD, the C index for incident cancer increased from 0.618 (95\% CI: 0.570-0.672) to 0.971 (95\% CI: 0.963-0.978) when adjusting the models for the combined cancer and CVD DMPs identified in the other cohorts.
CONCLUSIONS: These results point to molecular pathways and potential treatments for precision prevention of CVD and cancer. Screening based on common epigenetic signatures of incident CVD and cancer may help identify patients with newly diagnosed CVD at increased cancer risk.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Older adults racialized as Black experience higher rates of dementia than those racialized as White. Structural racism produces socioeconomic challenges, described by artist Marvin Gaye as "hang ups, let downs, bad breaks, setbacks" that likely contribute to dementia disparities. Robust dementia literature suggests socioeconomic factors may also be key resiliencies.
METHODS: We linked state-level data reflecting the racialized landscape of economic opportunity across the 20th Century from the U.S. Census (1930-2010) with individual-level data on cognitive outcomes from the U.S. Health and Retirement Study participants racialized as Black. A purposive sample of participants born after the Brown v. Board ruling (born 1954-59) were selected who completed the modified Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status between 2010 and 2020 (N=1381). We tested associations of exposure to structural racism and resilience before birth, and during childhood, young-adulthood, and midlife with cognitive trajectories in mid-late life using mixed-effects regression models.
RESULTS: Older adults born in places with higher state-level structural socioeconomic racism experienced a more rapid cognitive decline in later life compared to those with lower levels of exposure. In addition, participants born in places with higher levels of state-level structural socioeconomic resilience experienced slower cognitive change over time than their counterparts.
DISCUSSION: These findings reveal the impact of racist U.S. policies enacted in the past that influence cognitive health over time and dementia risk later in life.},

While highlighting some common features of aging, the survey exposed broad disagreement on the foundational issues. What is aging? What causes it? When does it begin? What constitutes rejuvenation? Not only was there no consensus on these and other core questions, but none of the questions received a majority opinion—even regarding the need for consensus itself. Despite many researchers believing they understand aging, their understanding diverges considerably. Importantly, as different processes are labeled as “aging” by researchers, different experimental approaches are prioritized. The survey shed light on the need to better define which aging processes this field should target and what its goals are. It also allowed us to categorize contemporary views on aging and rejuvenation, revealing critical, yet largely unanswered, questions that appear disconnected from the current research focus.

	abstract = {Despite the prominence of the weathering hypothesis as a mechanism underlying racialized inequities in morbidity and mortality, the life course social and economic determinants of Black-White disparities in biological aging remain inadequately understood. This study uses data from the Health and Retirement Study (n = 6,782), multivariable regression, and Kitagawa-Blinder-Oaxaca decomposition to assess Black-White disparities across three measures of biological aging: PhenoAge, Klemera-Doubal biological age, and homeostatic dysregulation. It also examines the contributions of racial differences in life course socioeconomic and stress exposures and vulnerability to those exposures to Black-White disparities in biological aging. Across the outcomes, Black individuals exhibited accelerated biological aging relative to White individuals. Decomposition analyses showed that racial differences in life course socioeconomic exposures accounted for roughly 27\% to 55\% of the racial disparities across the biological aging measures, and racial disparities in psychosocial stress exposure explained 7\% to 11\%. We found less evidence that heterogeneity in the associations between social exposures and biological aging by race contributed substantially to Black-White disparities in biological aging. Our findings offer new evidence of the role of life course social exposures in generating disparities in biological aging, with implications for understanding age patterns of morbidity and mortality risks.},

To test this hypothesis, we evaluated prospective associations between biological age and incident depression and anxiety in 424,299 UK Biobank participants.

During a median of 8.7 years of follow-up, participants with older biological age were at increased risk of incident depression/anxiety (5.9\% increase per standard deviation [SD] of KDM-BA acceleration, 95\% confidence intervals [CI]: 3.3\%–8.5\%; 11.3\% increase per SD of PhenoAge acceleration, 95\% CI: 9.\%–13.0\%).

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Inorganic arsenic (As) may increase the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and all-cause mortality through accelerated aging, which can be estimated using epigenetic-based measures.
OBJECTIVES: We evaluated three DNA methylation-based aging measures (PhenoAge, GrimAge, DunedinPACE) (epigenetic aging measures) as potential mediators of the previously reported association of As exposure with CVD incidence, CVD mortality, and all-cause mortality in the Strong Heart Study (SHS), an epidemiological cohort of American Indian adults.
METHODS: Blood DNA methylation and urinary As levels were measured in 2,323 SHS participants (41.5\% men, mean age of 55 years old). PhenoAge and GrimAge values were calculated using a residual-based method. We tested the association of urinary As with epigenetic aging measures using linear regression, the association of epigenetic aging measures with the three health outcomes using additive hazards models, and the mediation of As-related CVD incidence, CVD mortality, and all-cause mortality by epigenetic aging measures using the product of coefficients method.
RESULTS: SHS participants with higher vs. lower urinary As levels had similar PhenoAge age, older GrimAge age, and faster DunedinPACE. An interquartile range increase in urinary As was associated with higher of PhenoAge age acceleration [mean difference (95\% confidence interval)=0.48 (0.17, 0.80) years], GrimAge age acceleration [0.80 (0.60, 1.00) years], and DunedinPACE [0.011 (0.005, 0.018)], after adjusting for age, sex, center location, genetic components, smoking status, and body mass index. Of the 347 incident CVD events per 100,000 person-years associated with a doubling in As exposure, 21.3\% (9.1, 57.1) and 22.6\% (9.5, 56.9), were attributable to differences in GrimAge and DunedinPACE, respectively.
DISCUSSION: Arsenic exposure was associated with older GrimAge and faster DunedinPACE measures of biological age. Furthermore, accelerated biological aging measured from DNA methylation accounted for a relevant fraction of As-associated risk for CVD, CVD mortality, and all-cause mortality in the SHS, supporting the role of As in accelerated aging. Research of the biological underpinnings can contribute to a better understanding of the role of aging in arsenic-related disease. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP11981.},

The dataset offers a valuable life course panorama, encompassing living conditions, socioeconomic status, familial connections, personality traits, values, preferences, health, and well-being. To amplify research opportunities further, we have extended the SOEP Innovation Sample (SOEP-IS) by collecting genetic data from 2,598 participants, yielding the first genotyped dataset for Germany based on a representative population sample (SOEP-G). The sample includes 107 full-sibling pairs, 501 parent-offspring pairs, and 152 triads, which overlap with the parent-offspring pairs. Leveraging the results from well-powered genome-wide association studies, we created a repository comprising 66 polygenic indices (PGIs) in the SOEP-G sample. We show that the PGIs for height, BMI, and educational attainment capture 22∼24\%, 12∼13\%, and 9\% of the variance in the respective phenotypes. Using the PGIs for height and BMI, we demonstrate that the considerable increase in average height and the decrease in average BMI in more recent birth cohorts cannot be attributed to genetic shifts within the German population or to age effects alone. These findings suggest an important role of improved environmental conditions in driving these changes. Furthermore, we show that higher values in the PGIs for educational attainment and the highest math class are associated with better self-rated health, illustrating complex relationships between genetics, cognition, behavior, socio-economic status, and health. In summary, the SOEP-G data and the PGI repository we created provide a valuable resource for studying individual differences, inequalities, life-course development, health, and interactions between genetic predispositions and the environment.},

	abstract = {Policy Points The Paycheck Plus randomized controlled trial tested a fourfold increase in the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) for single adults without dependent children over 3 years in New York and Atlanta. In New York, the intervention improved economic, mental, and physical health outcomes. In Atlanta, it had no economic benefit or impact on physical health and may have worsened mental health. In Atlanta, tax filing and bonus receipt were lower than in the New York arm of the trial, which may explain the lack of economic benefits. Lower mental health scores in the treatment group were driven by disadvantaged men, and the study sample was in good mental health.
CONTEXT: The Paycheck Plus experiment examined the effects of an enhanced Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) for single adults on economic and health outcomes in Atlanta, GA and New York City (NYC). The NYC study was completed two years prior to the Atlanta study and found mental and physical benefits for the subgroups that responded best to the economic incentives provided. In this article, we present the findings from the Atlanta study, in which the uptake of the treatment (tax filings and EITC bonus) were lower and economic and health benefits were not observed.
METHODS: Paycheck Plus Atlanta was an unblinded randomized controlled trial that assigned n = 3,971 participants to either the standard federal EITC (control group) or an EITC supplement of up to \$2,000 (treatment group) for three tax years (2017-2019). Administrative data on employment and earnings were obtained from the Georgia Department of Labor and survey data were used to examine validated measures of health and well-being.
FINDINGS: In Atlanta, the treatment group had significantly higher earnings in the first project year but did not have significantly higher cumulative earnings than the control group overall (mean difference = \$1,812, 95\% CI = -150, 3,774, p = 0.07). The treatment group also had significantly lower scores on two measures of mental health after the intervention was complete: the Patient Health Questionnaire 8 (mean difference = 0.19, 95\% CI = 0.06, 0.32, p = 0.005) and the Kessler 6 (mean difference = 0.15, 95\% CI = 0.03, 0.27, p = 0.012). Secondary analyses suggested these results were driven by disadvantaged men, but the study sample was in good mental health.
CONCLUSIONS: The EITC experiment in Atlanta was not associated with gains in earnings or improvements in physical or mental health.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The drivers of human life expectancy gains over the past 200 years are not well-established, with a potential role for historical reductions in infectious disease. We investigate whether infectious exposures in infancy predict biological aging using DNA methylation-based markers that forecast patterns of morbidity and mortality later in life.
METHODS: N = 1450 participants from the Cebu Longitudinal Health and Nutrition Survey-a prospective birth cohort initiated in 1983-provided complete data for the analyses. Mean chronological age was 20.9 years when venous whole blood samples were drawn for DNA extraction and methylation analysis, with subsequent calculation of three epigenetic age markers: Horvath, GrimAge, and DunedinPACE. Unadjusted and adjusted least squares regression models were evaluated to test the hypothesis that infectious exposures in infancy are associated with epigenetic age.
RESULTS: Birth in the dry season, a proxy measure for increased infectious exposure in the first year of life, as well as the number of symptomatic infections in the first year of infancy, predicted lower epigenetic age. Infectious exposures were associated with the distribution of white blood cells in adulthood, which were also associated with measures of epigenetic age.
CONCLUSIONS: We document negative associations between measures of infectious exposure in infancy and DNA methylation-based measures of aging. Additional research, across a wider range of epidemiological settings, is needed to clarify the role of infectious disease in shaping immunophenotypes and trajectories of biological aging and human life expectancy.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To examine the association between types of loneliness (transient, incident, and chronic) and the risk of functional disability.
METHODS: Data were from the Health and Retirement Study 2006/2008-2016/2018. A total of 7,148 adults aged ≥50 was included. Functional status was measured by activities of daily living (ADL) and instrumental activities of daily living (IADL). Loneliness was assessed using the 3-item UCLA Loneliness Scale. We defined loneliness as no/transient/incident/chronic loneliness based on the pattern and duration of loneliness across 2006/2008 and 2010/2012. We applied multivariate Cox proportional hazard models with the new-onset ADL/IADL disability as outcome.
RESULTS: Overall, 69.3\% respondents showed no loneliness; while 10.3\%, 8.9\%, and 11.5\% showed transient, incident, and chronic loneliness, respectively. A total of 1,298 (18.16\%) and 1,260 (17.63\%) functionally normal respondents developed ADL and IADL disability during 36,294 person-years of follow-up, respectively. After adjusting for socio-demographic, behavioral, and health factors, chronic loneliness was associated with higher risks of ADL (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.37, 95\% confidence interval [CI] = 1.16-1.63, p {\textless}0.001, χ2 = 3.60, degree of freedom [df] = 1) and IADL disability (HR = 1.25, 95\% CI = 1.09-1.44, p = 0.002, χ2 = 3.17, df = 1) compared to no loneliness. By contrast, no significant associations between transient loneliness and ADL (HR = 1.17, 95\% CI = 0.88-1.57, p = 0.273, χ2 = 1.10, df = 1) or IADL disability (HR = 1.16, 95\% CI = 0.97-1.39, p = 0.112, χ2 = 1.59, df = 1) were found. Chronic loneliness was not associated with the risk of IADL disability in men (HR = 1.13, 95\% CI = 0.91-1.40, p = 0.263, χ2 = 1.12, df = 1).
CONCLUSION: Chronic loneliness, rather than transient loneliness, is an independent risk factor for functional disability in middle-aged and older adults, especially for women.},

	doi = {10.1186/s13148-023-01489-7},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Individuals who are socioeconomically disadvantaged are at increased risk for aging-related diseases and perform less well on tests of cognitive function. The weathering hypothesis proposes that these disparities in physical and cognitive health arise from an acceleration of biological processes of aging. Theories of how life adversity is biologically embedded identify epigenetic alterations, including DNA methylation (DNAm), as a mechanistic interface between the environment and health. Consistent with the weathering hypothesis and theories of biological embedding, recently developed DNAm algorithms have revealed profiles reflective of more advanced aging and lower cognitive function among socioeconomically-at-risk groups. These DNAm algorithms were developed using blood-DNA, but social and behavioral science research commonly collect saliva or cheek-swab DNA. This discrepancy is a potential barrier to research to elucidate mechanisms through which socioeconomic disadvantage affects aging and cognition. We therefore tested if social gradients observed in blood DNAm measures could be reproduced using buccal-cell DNA obtained from cheek swabs.
RESULTS: We analyzed three DNAm measures of biological aging and one DNAm measure of cognitive performance, all of which showed socioeconomic gradients in previous studies: the PhenoAge and GrimAge DNAm clocks, DunedinPACE, and Epigenetic-g. We first computed blood-buccal cross-tissue correlations in n = 21 adults (GEO111165). Cross-tissue correlations were low-to-moderate (r = .25 to r = .48). We next conducted analyses of socioeconomic gradients using buccal DNAm data from SOEP-G (n = 1128, 57\% female; age mean = 42 yrs, SD = 21.56, range 0-72). Associations of socioeconomic status with DNAm measures of aging were in the expected direction, but were smaller as compared to reports from blood DNAm datasets (r = - .08 to r = - .13).
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings are consistent with the hypothesis that socioeconomic disadvantage is associated with DNAm indicators of worse physical health. However, relatively low cross-tissue correlations and attenuated effect sizes for socioeconomic gradients in buccal DNAm compared with reports from analysis of blood DNAm suggest that in order to take full advantage of buccal DNA samples, DNAm algorithms customized to buccal DNAm are needed.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Individuals with more education are at lower risk of developing multiple, different age-related diseases than their less-educated peers. A reason for this might be that individuals with more education age slower. There are 2 complications in testing this hypothesis. First, there exists no definitive measure of biological aging. Second, shared genetic factors contribute toward both lower educational attainment and the development of age-related diseases. Here, we tested whether the protective effect of educational attainment was associated with the pace of aging after accounting for genetic factors.
METHODS: We examined data from 5 studies together totaling almost 17,000 individuals with European ancestry born in different countries during different historical periods, ranging in age from 16 to 98 years old. To assess the pace of aging, we used DunedinPACE, a DNA methylation algorithm that reflects an individual's rate of aging and predicts age-related decline and Alzheimer's disease and related disorders. To assess genetic factors related to education, we created a polygenic score based on the results of a genome-wide association study of educational attainment.
RESULTS: Across the 5 studies, and across the life span, higher educational attainment was associated with a slower pace of aging even after accounting for genetic factors (meta-analysis effect size = -0.20; 95\% confidence interval [CI]: -0.30 to -0.10; p = .006). Further, this effect persisted after taking into account tobacco smoking (meta-analysis effect size = -0.13; 95\% CI: -0.21 to -0.05; p = .01).
DISCUSSION: These results indicate that higher levels of education have positive effects on the pace of aging, and that the benefits can be realized irrespective of individuals' genetics.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Native American communities suffer disproportionately from elevated metal exposures and increased risk for cardiovascular diseases and diabetes. DNA methylation is a sensitive biomarker of aging-related processes and novel epigenetic-based "clocks" can be used to estimate accelerated biological aging that may underlie increased risk. Metals alter DNA methylation, yet little is known about their individual and combined impact on epigenetic age acceleration. Our objective was to investigate the associations of metals on several DNA methylation-based aging measures in the Strong Heart Study (SHS) cohort.
METHODS: Blood DNA methylation data from 2,301 SHS participants was used to calculate age acceleration of epigenetic clocks (PhenoAge, GrimAge, DunedinPACE, Hannum, Horvath). Urinary metals [arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd), tungsten (W), zinc (Zn), selenium (Se), molybdenum (Mo)] were creatinine-adjusted and categorized into quartiles. We examined associations of individual metals through linear regression models and used Bayesian Kernel Machine Regression (BKMR) for the impact of the total metal mixture on epigenetic age acceleration.
RESULTS: The mixture of nonessential metals (W, As, Cd) was associated with greater GrimAge acceleration and DunedinPACE, while the essential metal mixture (Se, Zn, Mo) was associated with lower epigenetic age acceleration. Cd was associated with increased epigenetic age acceleration across all clocks and BKMR analysis suggested nonlinear associations between Se and DunedinPACE, GrimAge, and PhenoAge acceleration. No interactions between individual metals were observed. The associations between Cd, Zn, and epigenetic age acceleration were greater in never smokers in comparison to current/former smokers.
CONCLUSION: Nonessential metals were positively associated with greater epigenetic age acceleration, with strongest associations observed between Cd and DunedinPACE and GrimAge acceleration. In contrast, essential metals were associated with lower epigenetic aging. Examining the influence of metal mixtures on epigenetic age acceleration can provide insight into metals and aging-related diseases.},

CALERIETM randomized 220 healthy, nonobese adults in a 2:1 allocation to 2 years of CR or ad libitum (AL) diet. The average CR in the treatment group through 24 months of follow-up was 12\%. Whole blood (baseline, 12, and 24 months) DNAm profiles were measured. Epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) analysis tested CR-induced changes from baseline to 12 and 24 months in the n = 197 participants with available DNAm data. CR treatment was not associated with epigenome-wide significant (false discovery rate [FDR] \&lt; 0.05) DNAm changes at the individual-CpG-site level. Secondary analysis of sets of CpG sites identified in published EWAS revealed that CR induced DNAm changes opposite to those associated with higher body mass index and cigarette smoking (p \&lt; .003 at 12- and 24-month follow-ups). In contrast, CR altered DNAm at chronological-age-associated CpG sites in the direction of older age (p \&lt; .003 at 12- and 24-month follow-ups). Although individual CpG site DNAm changes in response to CR were not identified, analyses of sets CpGs identified in prior EWAS revealed CR-induced changes to blood DNAm. Altered CpG sets were enriched for insulin production, glucose tolerance, inflammation, and DNA-binding and DNA-regulation pathways, several of which are known to be modified by CR. DNAm changes may contribute to CR effects on aging.},

Identifying the maternal factors that contribute to adverse birth outcomes in the next generation is thus a priority. Epigenetic clocks, which have emerged as powerful tools for quantifying biological aging and various dimensions of physiological dysregulation, hold promise for clarifying relationships between maternal biology and infant health, including the maternal factors or states that predict birth outcomes. Nevertheless, studies exploring the relationship between maternal epigenetic age and birth outcomes remain few. Here, we attempt to replicate a series of analyses previously reported in a US-based sample, using a larger similarly aged sample (n = 296) of participants of a long-running study in the Philippines. New pregnancies were identified prospectively, dried blood spot samples were collected during the third trimester, and information was obtained on gestational age at delivery and offspring weight after birth. Genome-wide DNA methylation was assessed with the Infinium EPIC array. Using a suite of 15 epigenetic clocks, we only found one significant relationship: advanced age on the epigenetic clock trained on leptin predicted a significantly earlier gestational age at delivery (β = - 0.15, p = 0.009). Of the other 29 relationships tested predicting gestational age and offspring birth weight, none were statistically significant. In this sample of Filipino women, epigenetic clocks capturing multiple dimensions of biology and health do not predict birth outcomes in offspring.},

	abstract = {People exposed to adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) suffer from an increased risk of chronic disease and shorter lifespan. These individuals also tend to exhibit accelerated reproductive development and show signs of advanced cellular aging as early as childhood. These observations suggest that ACEs may accelerate biological processes of aging through direct or indirect mechanisms; however, few population-based studies have data to test this hypothesis. We analysed ACEs and biological aging data from the Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging (CLSA; n = 23,354 adults aged 45-85) and used the BioAge R package to compute three indices of biological aging from blood-chemistry and organ-function data: Klemera-Doubal method (KDM) biological age, phenotypic age (PA), and homeostatic dysregulation (HD). Adults with ACEs tended to be biologically older than those with no ACEs, although the observed effect-sizes were small (Cohen's d{\textless}0.15), with the exception of neglect (d=0.35 for KDM and PA). Associations were similar for men and women and tended to be smaller for older as compared to midlife participants. Subtypes of ACEs perceived as being more severe (e.g., being pushed or kicked, experiencing forced sexual activity, witnessing physical violence) and more frequent and diverse exposures were associated with relatively larger effect-sizes. These findings support the hypothesis that ACEs contribute to accelerated biological aging, although replication is needed in studies with access to prospective records of ACEs and cellular-level measurements of biological aging. Furthermore, future work to better understand the degree to which associations between ACEs and biological aging are moderated by specific life-course pathways, and mediated by lifestyle and socioeconomic factors is warranted.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Biological aging represents a loss of integrity and functionality of physiological systems over time. While associated with an enhanced risk of adverse outcomes such as hospitalization, disability and death following infection, its role in perceived age-related declines in vaccine responses has yet to be fully elucidated. Using data and biosamples from a 4-year clinical trial comparing immune responses of standard- and high-dose influenza vaccination, we quantified biological age (BA) prior to vaccination in adults over 65 years old (n = 292) using a panel of ten serological biomarkers (albumin, alanine aminotransferase, creatinine, ferritin, free thyroxine, cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein, triglycerides, tumour necrosis factor, interleukin-6) as implemented in the BioAge R package. Hemagglutination inhibition antibody titres against influenza A/H1N1, A/H3N2 and B were quantified prior to vaccination and 4-, 10- and 20- weeks post-vaccination.
RESULTS: Counter to our hypothesis, advanced BA was associated with improved post-vaccination antibody titres against the different viral types and subtypes. However, this was dependent on both vaccine dose and CMV serostatus, as associations were only apparent for high-dose recipients (d = 0.16-0.26), and were largely diminished for CMV positive high-dose recipients.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings emphasize two important points: first, the loss of physiological integrity related to biological aging may not be a ubiquitous driver of immune decline in older adults; and second, latent factors such as CMV infection (prevalent in up to 90\% of older adults worldwide) may contribute to the heterogeneity in vaccine responses of older adults more than previously thought.},

DNA methylation algorithms are increasingly used to estimate biological aging; however, how these proposed measures of whole-organism biological aging relate to aging in the brain is not known. We used data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) and the Framingham Heart Study (FHS) Offspring Cohort to test the association between blood-based DNA methylation measures of biological aging and cognitive impairment and dementia in older adults.
Methods
We tested 3 “generations” of DNA methylation age algorithms (first generation: Horvath and Hannum clocks; second generation: PhenoAge and GrimAge; and third generation: DunedinPACE, Dunedin Pace of Aging Calculated from the Epigenome) against the following measures of cognitive impairment in ADNI: clinical diagnosis of dementia and mild cognitive impairment, scores on Alzheimer disease (AD) / Alzheimer disease and related dementias (ADRD) screening tests (Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale, Mini-Mental State Examination, and Montreal Cognitive Assessment), and scores on cognitive tests (Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test, Logical Memory test, and Trail Making Test). In an independent replication in the FHS Offspring Cohort, we further tested the longitudinal association between the DNA methylation algorithms and the risk of developing dementia.
Results
In ADNI (N = 649 individuals), the first-generation (Horvath and Hannum DNA methylation age clocks) and the second-generation (PhenoAge and GrimAge) DNA methylation measures of aging were not consistently associated with measures of cognitive impairment in older adults. By contrast, a third-generation measure of biological aging, DunedinPACE, was associated with clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer disease (beta [95\% CI] = 0.28 [0.08–0.47]), poorer scores on Alzheimer disease/ADRD screening tests (beta [Robust SE] = −0.10 [0.04] to 0.08[0.04]), and cognitive tests (beta [Robust SE] = −0.12 [0.04] to 0.10 [0.03]). The association between faster pace of aging, as measured by DunedinPACE, and risk of developing dementia was confirmed in a longitudinal analysis of the FHS Offspring Cohort (N = 2,264 individuals, hazard ratio [95\% CI] = 1.27 [1.07–1.49]).
Discussion
Third-generation blood-based DNA methylation measures of aging could prove valuable for measuring differences between individuals in the rate at which they age and in their risk for cognitive decline, and for evaluating interventions to slow aging.},

Animals with mutations in clock genes display accelerated aging and shortened life span.

We analyzed accelerometry and physiological data from 7 539 adults participating in the 2011-2014 waves of the U.S. National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys. We used accelerometry data to compute rest-activity rhythm measurements. We used physiological data to compute measurements of biological aging according to 3 published algorithms: Klemera-Doubal method (KDM) Biological Age, PhenoAge, and homeostatic dysregulation (HD). In the models adjusting multiple covariates, participants with higher relative amplitude (RA) and interdaily stability (IS) and lower intradaily variability (IV) exhibited less advanced biological aging indexed by KDM and PhenoAge (effect sizes for 1-quantile increase in these rest-activity measurements ranged from 0.54 to 0.57 "years" for RA, 0.24 to 0.28 "years" for IS, and 0.24 to 0.35 "years" for IV, ps {\textless} .001). Similar finding was observed for biological aging indexed by HD, but the significance was limited to RA with 1-quantile increase in RA associated with 0.09 log units decrease in HD (p {\textless} .001).

              Chaotic home environments may contribute to children's attention‐deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptoms. However, ADHD genetic risk may also influence household chaos. This study investigated whether children in chaotic households had more ADHD symptoms, if mothers and children with higher ADHD genetic risk lived in more chaotic households, and the joint association of genetic risk and household chaos on the longitudinal course of ADHD symptoms across childhood.
            
            
              Methods
              
                Participants were mothers and children from the Environmental Risk (E‐Risk) Longitudinal Twin Study, a UK population‐representative birth cohort of 2,232 twins. Children's ADHD symptoms were assessed at ages 5, 7, 10 and 12 years. Household chaos was rated by research workers at ages 7, 10 and 12, and by mother's and twin's self‐report at age 12. Genome‐wide ADHD polygenic risk scores (PRS) were calculated for mothers (
                n
                 = 880) and twins (
                n

                n
                 = 871 mothers and
                n
                 = 1,925 children had information on children's ADHD and household chaos.
              
            
            
              Results
              Children in more chaotic households had higher ADHD symptoms. Mothers and children with higher ADHD PRS lived in more chaotic households. Children's ADHD PRS was associated with household chaos over and above mother's PRS, suggesting evocative gene–environment correlation. Children in more chaotic households had higher baseline ADHD symptoms and a slower rate of decline in symptoms. However, sensitivity analyses estimated that gene–environment correlation accounted for a large proportion of the association of household chaos on ADHD symptoms.
            
            
              Conclusions
              Children's ADHD genetic risk was independently associated with higher levels of household chaos, emphasising the active role of children in shaping their home environment. Our findings suggest that household chaos partly reflects children's genetic risk for ADHD, calling into question whether household chaos directly influences children's core ADHD symptoms. Our findings highlight the importance of considering parent and child genetic risk in relation to apparent environmental exposures.},

Vitality capacity is considered the underlying physiological determinant of intrinsic capacity. To advance the measurement and monitoring of vitality capacity, a working group of WHO staff members and twenty experts representing six WHO regions was convened to discuss and clarify the attributes of vitality capacity and to develop a clear working definition of the concept. Potential biomarkers to measure vitality capacity were identified, and the following consensual working definition was developed: vitality capacity is a physiological state (due to normal or accelerated biological ageing processes) resulting from the interaction between multiple physiological systems, reflected in (the level of) energy and metabolism, neuromuscular function, and immune and stress response functions of the body.},

              Objectives
              To better understand the temporal dynamics of progression from cognitive decline to onset of dementia in the dementia-free older population in the United States.
            
            
              Methods
              We used longitudinal data from a diverse national population-based sample of older adults (N = 531) in the Aging, Demographics, and Memory Study from the Health and Retirement Study with repeated measures of cognitive function and dementia diagnosis during 12 years of follow-up from 1996 to 2009. We employed joint latent class mixed models to estimate the association between cognitive change and competing risks of dementia and nondementia death and identify heterogeneity in the age profiles of such association adjusting for baseline characteristics.
            
            
              Results
              Our analyses found 3 latent classes with distinct age profiles of cognitive decline and associated risk of dementia and mortality: “Rapid Cognitive Decline” (19.6\%), “Moderate Progression” (44.6\%), and “Optimal Cognitive Aging” (35.8\%). When simultaneously accounting for cognitive trajectories and time-to-dementia/death, we also found associations of baseline covariates with slope of cognitive decline (e.g., steeper decline among non-Hispanic Blacks and more educated) and risk of dementia (e.g., greater risk for females and apolipoprotein E-4 carriers, but no difference by education level) that differ substantially from those in separate longitudinal mixed models or survival models.
            
            
              Discussion
              The differential age patterns of cognitive decline predicting dementia incidences identified in this study suggest variation in the course of cognitive aging in older adults that may inform future etiological and intervention studies.},

	abstract = {Methods to quantify biological aging are emerging as new measurement tools for epidemiology and population science and have been proposed as surrogate measures for healthy lifespan extension in geroscience clinical trials. Publicly available software packages to compute biological aging measurements from DNA methylation data have accelerated dissemination of these measures and generated rapid gains in knowledge about how different measures perform in a range of datasets. Biological age measures derived from blood chemistry data were introduced at the same time as the DNA methylation measures and, in multiple studies, demonstrate superior performance to these measures in prediction of healthy lifespan. However, their dissemination has been slow by comparison, resulting in a significant gap in knowledge. We developed a software package to help address this knowledge gap. The BioAge R package, available for download at GitHub (http://github.com/dayoonkwon/BioAge), implements three published methods to quantify biological aging based on analysis of chronological age and mortality risk: Klemera-Doubal biological age, PhenoAge, and homeostatic dysregulation. The package allows users to parametrize measurement algorithms using custom sets of biomarkers, to compare the resulting measurements to published versions of the Klemera-Doubal method and PhenoAge algorithms, and to score the measurements in new datasets. We applied BioAge to safety lab data from the CALERIE™ randomized controlled trial, the first-ever human trial of long-term calorie restriction in healthy, non-obese adults, to test effects of intervention on biological aging. Results contribute evidence that CALERIE intervention slowed biological aging. BioAge is a toolkit to facilitate measurement of biological age for geroscience.},

              Background
              Socioeconomic disadvantage is a well-established predictor of morbidity and mortality, and is thought to accelerate the aging process. This study examined associations between life-course socioeconomic conditions and the Pace of Aging, a longitudinal measure of age-related physiological decline.
            
            
              Methods
              Data were drawn from a Swiss population-based cohort of individuals originally recruited between 2003 and 2006, and followed up for 11 years (2 834 women, 2 475 men aged 35–75 years [mean 52]). Pace of Aging was measured using 3 repeated assessments of 12 biomarkers reflecting multiple body systems. Analysis tested associations of socioeconomic conditions with physiological status at baseline and with the Pace of Aging.
            
            
              Results
              Participants with more life-course socioeconomic disadvantage were physiologically older at baseline and experienced faster Pace of Aging. Effect sizes (β) for associations of childhood socioeconomic disadvantage with baseline physiological status ranged from 0.1 to 0.2; for adulthood socioeconomic disadvantage, effect sizes ranged from 0.2 to 0.3. Effect sizes were smaller for associations with the Pace of Aging (\&lt;0.05 for childhood disadvantage, 0.05–0.1 for adulthood disadvantage). Those who experienced disadvantaged socioeconomic conditions from childhood to adulthood aged 10\% faster over the 11 years of follow-up as compared with those who experienced consistently advantaged socioeconomic conditions. Covariate adjustment for health behaviors attenuated associations, but most remained statistically significant.
            
            
              Conclusions
              Socioeconomic inequalities contribute to a faster Pace of Aging, partly through differences in health behaviors. Intervention to slow aging in at-risk individuals is needed by midlife, before etiology of aging-related diseases become established.},

	abstract = {Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) can affect development in ways that disrupt the formation of human capital and contribute to later-life morbidity and mortality. Theories of development predict that the timing of adversity will affect its outcomes. However, empirical evidence for timing-specific effects remains scant. In this issue of JAMA Network Open, Andersen reports an analysis of population-register data from Denmark that suggests timing-specific associations of household dysfunction ACEs with young people’s successful transition to adulthood. Andersen’s study linked data from several Danish registers to compose records tracking children born between 1987 and 1995 and their families from the child’s birth until they reached age 19 years. The analysis tested how exposure to household dysfunction ACEs during ages 0 to 2, 3 to 5, 6 to 12, and 13 to 17 years were associated with disruptions in children’s transition to adulthood. Children’s ACE exposure was measured from records of parental unemployment, incarceration, psychiatric diagnoses, and divorce as well as children’s placement in foster care. Disruption to the transition to adulthood was measured from records of education, employment, criminal charges, and psychiatric diagnoses. Andersen’s analysis compared siblings in the same family who experienced household dysfunction ACEs at different stages of development, eg, when a younger sibling’s early-childhood exposure was simultaneously their older sibling’s middle-childhood exposure. Using this sibling comparison design, Andersen identified a dose-response association between accumulation of ACEs and increased likelihood of experiencing disruption to the transition to adulthood. Adversity exposures during adolescence (ages 13-17 years) had larger magnitude risk associations compared with adversities that occurred earlier in development. Effect sizes for adolescent exposures were nearly 2-fold those for exposures in middle childhood and more than 3-fold those for exposures earlier in life. The findings of stronger associations for exposures during adolescence contrast with the popular narrative of the first 1000 days as a unique window of opportunity to promote positive development. They are also at odds with theoretical estimates from models of dynamic skill formation, which suggest that investments during early childhood should have higher returns than investments later in life. Andersen’s results resonate with emerging research streams in both neuroscience and the social sciences to suggest that benefits of interventions in adolescence may be underappreciated.},

	abstract = {Children who grow up in socioeconomic disadvantage face increased burden of disease and disability throughout their lives. One hypothesized mechanism for this increased burden is that early-life disadvantage accelerates biological processes of aging, increasing vulnerability to subsequent disease. To evaluate this hypothesis and the potential impact of preventive interventions, measures are needed that can quantify early acceleration of biological aging in childhood.Saliva DNA methylation and socioeconomic circumstances were measured in N = 600 children and adolescents aged 8 to 18 years (48\% female) participating in the Texas Twin Project. We measured pace of biological aging using the DunedinPoAm DNA methylation algorithm, developed to quantify the pace-of-aging–related decline in system integrity. We tested if children in more disadvantaged families and neighborhoods exhibited a faster pace of aging as compared with children in more affluent contexts.Children living in more disadvantaged families and neighborhoods exhibited a faster DunedinPoAm-measured pace of aging (r = 0.18; P = .001 for both). Latinx-identifying children exhibited a faster DunedinPoAm-measured pace of aging compared with both White- and Latinx White–identifying children, consistent with higher levels of disadvantage in this group. Children with more advanced pubertal development, higher BMI, and more tobacco exposure exhibited faster a faster DunedinPoAm-measured pace of aging. However, DunedinPoAm-measured pace of aging associations with socioeconomic disadvantage were robust to control for these factors.Children growing up under conditions of socioeconomic disadvantage exhibit a faster pace of biological aging. DNA methylation pace of aging might be useful as a surrogate end point in evaluation of programs and policies to address the childhood social determinants of lifelong health disparities.},

Etiology of frailty extends across the lifespan and may begin in early life, but empirical evidence for this association is scarce. In this study, we examined whether adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) are associated with frailty in later life. \textbf{\textit{Methods:}} We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of data for a population-based sample of 27,748 adults aged 45–85 years from the Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging. The frailty index (FI) was computed with 76 health-related characteristics of physical and cognitive performance, self-rated health, chronic conditions, visual and hearing ability, activities of daily living, and well-being. Self-reported exposure to ACEs included physical, emotional, and sexual abuse, neglect, and witnessing intimate partner violence prior age of 16 and parental death, divorce, and living with a family member with mental illness prior age of 18. Generalized linear regression models with gamma error distribution and identity link function, adjusted for age and sex, were used to examine associations of each ACE type and the number of ACE types (0, 1, 2, or 3+) reported by an individual with FI. All models were adjusted for income, education, smoking, and alcohol consumption in sensitivity analysis. \textbf{\textit{Results:}} Individuals exposed to ACEs had elevated levels of FI (mean = 0.13, SD = 0.09) than those unexposed, with the largest difference observed for neglect (\textit{B} [95\% CI]: 0.05 [0.04, 0.06]) and the smallest for parental death and divorce (0.015 [0.01,0.02]). The ACE count was associated with frailty in a graded manner, with the FI difference reaching 0.04 [0.037, 0.044] for participants exposed to 3+ ACE types. The association between ACEs and frailty tended to be stronger for women than men and for men aged 45–64 years than older men. \textbf{\textit{Conclusions:}} Our study supports previous studies showing that exposure to ACEs is associated with frailty in adults. Our findings suggest that screening for ACEs involving childhood maltreatment may be useful for identifying individuals at risk of frailty and prevention of ACEs may have long-term benefits for healthy aging.},

              Background
              Dysregulation of some metabolic factors increases the risk of dementia. It remains unclear if overall metabolic dysregulation, or only certain components, contribute to cognitive aging and if these associations are sex specific.
            
            
              Methods
              Data from the 2006–2016 waves of the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) was used to analyze 7 103 participants aged 65 and older at baseline (58\% women). We created a metabolic-dysregulation risk score (MDRS) composed of blood pressure/hypertension status, glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c)/diabetes status, total cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and waist circumference, and assessed cognitive trajectories from repeated measures of the HRS-Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status (HRS-TICS) over 10 years of follow-up. Linear mixed-effects models estimated associations between MDRS or individual metabolic factors (biomarkers) with mean and change in HRS-TICS scores and assessed sex-modification of these associations.
            
            
              Results
              Participants with higher MDRSs had lower mean HRS-TICS scores, but there were no statistically significant differences in rate of decline. Sex stratification showed this association was present for women only. MDRS biomarkers revealed heterogeneity in the strength and direction of associations with HRS-TICS. Lower HRS-TICS levels were associated with hypertension, higher HbA1c/diabetes, and lower HDL-C and TC, whereas faster rate of cognitive decline was associated with hypertension, higher HbA1c/diabetes, and higher TC. Participants with higher HbA1c/diabetes presented worse cognitive trajectories. Sex differences indicated that women with higher HbA1c/diabetes to have lower HRS-TICS levels, whereas hypertensive males presented better cognitive trajectory.
            
            
              Conclusions
              Our results demonstrate that metabolic dysregulation is more strongly associated with cognition in women compared with men, though sex differences vary by individual biomarker.},

	doi = {10.1111/jcpp.13224},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: A recent genome-wide association study identified molecular-genetic associations with age-at-first-birth. However, the meaning of these genetic discoveries is unclear. Drawing on evidence linking early pregnancy with disinhibitory behavior, we tested the hypothesis that genetic discoveries for age-at-first-birth predict disinhibition.
METHODS: We included participants with genotype data from the two-decade-long Environmental Risk (E-Risk) Study (N = 1,999) and the four-decade-long Dunedin Study (N = 918). We calculated a genome-wide polygenic score for age-at-first-birth and tested whether it was associated with a range of disinhibitory outcomes across the life course, including low childhood self-control; risk for externalizing psychopathology; officially recorded criminal offending; substance dependence; informant reports of disinhibitory problems; and number of lifetime sexual partners. We further tested whether associations were attributable to accelerated pubertal maturation.
RESULTS: In both cohorts, the age-at-first-birth polygenic score predicted low childhood self-control, externalizing psychopathology, officially recorded criminal offending, substance dependence, and number of sexual partners. Associations were modest, but robust across replication. Childhood disinhibition partly mediated associations between the polygenic score and reproductive behaviors. In contrast, associations were not attributable to accelerated pubertal timing.
CONCLUSIONS: Genomic discoveries for age-at-first-birth are about more than reproductive biology: They provide insight into the disinhibitory traits and behaviors that accompany early parenthood. Age-at-first-birth is a useful proxy phenotype for researchers interested in disinhibition. Further, interventions that improve self-regulation abilities may benefit young parents and their children.},

              Background
              Associations of socioenvironmental features like urbanicity and neighborhood deprivation with psychosis are well-established. An enduring question, however, is whether these associations are causal. Genetic confounding could occur due to downward mobility of individuals at high genetic risk for psychiatric problems into disadvantaged environments.
            
            
              Methods
              We examined correlations of five indices of genetic risk [polygenic risk scores (PRS) for schizophrenia and depression, maternal psychotic symptoms, family psychiatric history, and zygosity-based latent genetic risk] with multiple area-, neighborhood-, and family-level risks during upbringing. Data were from the Environmental Risk (E-Risk) Longitudinal Twin Study, a nationally-representative cohort of 2232 British twins born in 1994–1995 and followed to age 18 (93\% retention). Socioenvironmental risks included urbanicity, air pollution, neighborhood deprivation, neighborhood crime, neighborhood disorder, social cohesion, residential mobility, family poverty, and a cumulative environmental risk scale. At age 18, participants were privately interviewed about psychotic experiences.
            
            
              Results
              Higher genetic risk on all indices was associated with riskier environments during upbringing. For example, participants with higher schizophrenia PRS (OR = 1.19, 95\% CI = 1.06–1.33), depression PRS (OR = 1.20, 95\% CI = 1.08–1.34), family history (OR = 1.25, 95\% CI = 1.11–1.40), and latent genetic risk (OR = 1.21, 95\% CI = 1.07–1.38) had accumulated more socioenvironmental risks for schizophrenia by age 18. However, associations between socioenvironmental risks and psychotic experiences mostly remained significant after covariate adjustment for genetic risk.
            
            
              Conclusion
              Genetic risk is correlated with socioenvironmental risk for schizophrenia during upbringing, but the associations between socioenvironmental risk and adolescent psychotic experiences appear, at present, to exist above and beyond this gene-environment correlation.},

However, small effect sizes for individual variants, uncertainty regarding the biological function of discovered genotypes, and potential “outside-the-skin” environmental mechanisms leave a translational gulf between GWAS results and scientific understanding that will improve human health and well-being. We propose a set of social, behavioral, and brain-science research activities that map discovered genotypes to neural, developmental, and social mechanisms and call this research program phenotypic annotation. Phenotypic annotation involves (a) elaborating the nomological network surrounding discovered genotypes, (b) shifting focus from individual genes to whole genomes, and (c) testing how discovered genotypes affect life-span development. Phenotypic-annotation research is already advancing the understanding of GWAS discoveries for educational attainment and schizophrenia. We review examples and discuss methodological considerations for psychologists taking up the phenotypic-annotation approach.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Biological processes of aging are thought to be modifiable causes of many different chronic diseases. Measures of biological aging could provide sensitive endpoints for studies of risk factors hypothesized to shorten healthy lifespan and/or interventions that extend it. But uncertainty remains about how to measure biological aging and if proposed measures assess the same thing.
METHOD: We tested four proposed measures of biological aging that could be quantified with available data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), Klemera-Doubal method (KDM) Biological Age, homeostatic dysregulation, Levine Method (LM) Biological Age, and leukocyte telomere length.
RESULTS: We analyzed data collected during 1999-2002, when all four biological aging meausres could be taken. Participants' KDM biological ages, homeostatic dysregulation levels, LM biological ages, and telomere length were all correlated with their chronological ages. KDM Biological Age, homeostatic dysregulation, and LM Biological Age were all correlated with one another, but these measures were uncorrelated with telomere length. Participants' with more advanced biological aging performed worse on tests of physical, cognitive, and perceptual functioning and reported more limitations to their daily activities and more pain, and rated themselves as being in worse health. In parallel, participants with risk factors for shorter healthy lifespan exhibited more advanced biological aging. In both sets of analyses, effect-sizes tended to be larger for KDM Biological Age, homeostatic dysregulation, and LM Biological Age as compared to telomere length.
DISCUSSION: The cellular-level aging biomarker telomere length may measure different aspects of the aging process as compared to the patient-level physiological composite measures KDM Biological Age, homeostatic dysregulation, and LM Biological Age. Studies aiming to test if risk factors accelerate aging or if interventions may slow aging should not treat proposed measures of aging as interchangeable.},

However, methods of quantifying biological aging have been little studied in geriatric populations. We analyzed three clinical-biomarker-algorithm methods to quantify biological aging. Klemera–Doubal method Biological Age and homeostatic dysregulation algorithms were parameterized from analysis of U.S. National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES) data (N = 36,207) based on published methods. Levine method Biological Age was adapted from published analysis of NHANES data. Algorithms were applied to biomarker data from the Duke Established Populations for Epidemiologic Studies of the Elderly (Duke-EPESE) cohort of older adults (N = 1,374, aged 71–102 years, 35\% male, 52\% African American). We tested associations of biological aging measures with participant reported Activities of daily living (ADL), instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) dependencies, and mortality. We evaluated the sensitivity of results to the demographic composition of reference samples and biomarker sets used to develop biological aging algorithms. African American and white Duke-EPESE participants with more advanced biological aging reported dependence in more ADLs and IADLs and were at increased risk of death over follow-up through 2017. Effect sizes were similar across algorithms, but were strongest for Levine method Biological Age (per-quintile increase in ADL incidence rate ratio = 1.25, 95\% confidence interval [1.17–1.37], IADL incidence rate ratio = 1.23 [1.15–1.32], mortality hazard ratio = 1.12 [1.08–1.16]). Results were insensitive to demographic composition of reference samples, but modestly sensitive to the biomarker sets used to develop biological aging algorithms.

BrainAGE has been proposed as a biomarker of age-related deterioration of the brain. Having an older brainAGE has been linked to Alzheimer's, dementia, and mortality. However, these findings are largely based on cross-sectional associations which can confuse age differences with cohort differences. To illuminate the validity of brainAGE as a biomarker of accelerated brain aging, a study is needed of a large cohort all born in the same year who nevertheless vary on brainAGE. In the Dunedin Study, a population-representative 1972-73 birth cohort, we measured brainAGE at age 45 years, as well as the pace of biological aging and cognitive decline in longitudinal data from childhood to midlife (N = 869). In this cohort, all chronological age 45 years, brainAGE was measured reliably (ICC = 0.81) and ranged from 24 to 72 years. Those with older midlife brainAGEs tended to have poorer cognitive function in both adulthood and childhood, as well as impaired brain health at age 3. Furthermore, those with older brainAGEs had an accelerated pace of biological aging, older facial appearance, and early signs of cognitive decline from childhood to midlife. These findings help to validate brainAGE as a potential surrogate biomarker for midlife intervention studies that seek to measure dementia-prevention efforts in midlife. However, the findings also caution against the assumption that brainAGE scores represent only age-related deterioration of the brain as they may also index central nervous system variation present since childhood.},

Fluid and crystalized intellectual performance was assessed in the home at ages 5, 12, and 18 using the Wechsler Intelligence Scale, and executive function, working memory, and attention ability were assessed in the home at age 18 using the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery. Children living in residences surrounded by more neighborhood greenery scored significantly higher, on average, on IQ measures at all ages. However, the association between greenery and cognitive measures did not hold after accounting for family or neighborhood socioeconomic status. After adjustment for study covariates, child greenery exposure was not a significant predictor of longitudinal increases in IQ across childhood and adolescence or of executive function, working memory, or attention ability at age 18. Children raised in greener neighborhoods exhibit better overall cognitive ability, but the association is likely accounted for by family and neighborhood socioeconomic factors.},

We addressed concerns about the prognostic significance of adolescent borderline pathology by testing whether borderline symptoms at age 12 years predict functioning during the transition to adulthood, at age 18 years, in areas critical to life-course development.
METHOD: We studied members of the Environmental Risk (E-Risk) Longitudinal Twin Study, which tracks the development of a birth cohort of 2,232 British twin children. At age 12, study members' borderline symptoms were measured using mothers' reports. At age 18, study members' personality, psychopathology, functional outcomes, and experiences of victimization were measured using self-reports, coinformant reports, and official records.
RESULTS: At age 18, study members who had more borderline symptoms at age 12 were more likely to have difficult personalities, to struggle with poor mental health, to experience poor functional outcomes, and to have become victims of violence. Reports of poor outcomes were corroborated by coinformants and official records. Borderline symptoms in study members at 12 years old predicted poor outcomes over and above other behavioral and emotional problems during adolescence. Twin analyses showed that borderline symptoms in 12-year-olds were influenced by familial risk, particularly genetic risk, which accounted for associations with most poor outcomes at age 18.
CONCLUSION: Borderline symptoms in 12-year-olds signal risk for pervasive poor functioning during the transition to adulthood. This association is driven by genetic influences, suggesting that borderline symptoms and poor outcomes are manifestations of shared genetic risk.},

Research has identified social factors that predict incarceration risk, but scholars have called for a focus on the ways that individual differences combine with social factors to affect incarceration risk. Our study is an initial attempt to heed this call using whole-genome data. We use data from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) (N = 6716) to construct a genome-wide measure of genetic propensity for aggressive behavior and use it to predict lifetime incarceration risk. We find that participants with a higher genetic propensity for aggression are more likely to experience incarceration, but the effect is stronger for males than females. Importantly, we identify a gene-environment interaction (G × E)—genetic propensity is reduced, substantively and statistically, to a non-significant predictor for males raised in homes where at least one parent graduated high school. We close by placing these findings in the broader context of concerns that have been raised about genetics research in criminology.},

In aggregate, cancer- and treatment-related physical, cognitive, and psychosocial late- and long-term morbidities experienced by cancer survivors are hypothesized to represent accelerated or accentuated aging trajectories. However, conceptual, measurement, and methodological challenges have constrained efforts to identify, predict, and mitigate aging-related consequences of cancer and cancer treatment. In July 2018, the National Cancer Institute convened basic, clinical, and translational science experts for a think tank titled "Measuring Aging and Identifying Aging Phenotypes in Cancer Survivors." Through the resulting deliberations, several research and resource needs were identified, including longitudinal studies to examine aging trajectories that include detailed data from before, during, and after cancer treatment; mechanistic studies to elucidate the pathways that lead to the emergence of aging phenotypes in cancer survivors; long-term clinical surveillance to monitor survivors for late-emerging effects; and tools to integrate multiple data sources to inform understanding of how cancer and its therapies contribute to the aging process. Addressing these needs will help expand the evidence base and inform strategies to optimize healthy aging of cancer survivors.},

Where neighbourhood effects are causal, neighbourhood-level interventions can be effective.

To test how selection may affect different neighbourhood-linked problems, we linked neighbourhood data with genetic, health and social outcome data for {\textgreater}7,000 European-descent UK and US young people in the E-Risk and Add Health studies. We tested selection/concentration of genetic risks for obesity, schizophrenia, teen pregnancy and poor educational outcomes in high-risk neighbourhoods, including genetic analysis of neighbourhood mobility. Findings argue against genetic selection/concentration as an explanation for neighbourhood gradients in obesity and mental health problems. By contrast, modest genetic selection/concentration was evident for teen pregnancy and poor educational outcomes, suggesting that neighbourhood effects for these outcomes should be interpreted with care.},

However, the reliability of each of these measurements is not equal, and little consideration is paid to consequences for research. We correlated repeat measurements of the same DNA samples using the Illumina HumanMethylation450K and the Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChips in 350 blood DNA samples. Probes that were reliably measured were more heritable and showed consistent associations with environmental exposures, gene expression, and greater cross-tissue concordance. Unreliable probes were less replicable and generated an unknown volume of false negatives. This serves as a lesson for working with DNA methylation data, but the lessons are equally applicable to working with other data: as we advance toward generating increasingly greater volumes of data, failure to document reliability risks harming reproducibility.},

In this paper, we describe a case study in which leading global experts systematically: (1) developed a conceptual model that outlines the potential pathways through which a social policy influences health, (2) fits outcome measures to this conceptual model, and (3) estimates an optimal time frame for collection of the selected outcome measures. This systematic process, called the Delphi method, has the potential to produce estimates more quickly and with less bias than might be achieved through expert panel discussions alone.

A critical juncture in the STEM pipeline is the highly cumulative sequence of secondary school math courses. Students from disadvantaged schools are less likely to complete advanced math courses. Here, we conduct an analysis of how the math pipeline differs across schools using student polygenic scores, which are DNA-based indicators of propensity to succeed in education. We integrated genetic and official school transcript data from over 3000 European-ancestry students from U.S. high schools. We used polygenic scores as a molecular tracer to understand how the flow of students through the high school math pipeline differs in socioeconomically advantaged versus disadvantaged schools. Students with higher education polygenic scores were tracked to more advanced math already at the beginning of high school and persisted in math for more years. Analyses using genetics as a molecular tracer revealed that the dynamics of the math pipeline differed by school advantage. Compared to disadvantaged schools, advantaged schools buffered students with low polygenic scores from dropping out of math. Across all schools, even students with exceptional polygenic scores (top 2\%) were unlikely to take the most advanced math classes, suggesting substantial room for improvement in the development of potential STEM talent. These results link new molecular genetic discoveries to a common target of educational-policy reforms.},

	abstract = {Many studies have shown that estimates of biological age (BA) can predict health-related outcomes in older adults. Often, researchers employ multiple measures belonging to a variety of biological/physiological systems, and assess the validity of BA estimates by how well they approximate chronological age (CA). However, it is not clear whether this is the best approach for judging a BA estimate, or whether certain groups of measures are more informative to this end. Using data from the Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging, we composed panels of biological measures based on the physiological systems/domains they belong to (blood, organ function, physical/cognitive performance), and also composed a panel of measures that optimized the association of BA with CA. We then compared BA estimates for each according to their association with CA and health-related outcomes, including frailty, multimorbidity, chronic condition domains, disability, and health care utilization. Although BA estimated using all 40 measures (r = 0.74) or our age-optimized panel (r = 0.77) most closely approximated CA, the strength of associations to health-related outcomes was comparable or weaker than that of our panel composed only of physical performance measures (CA r = 0.59). All BA estimates were significantly associated to the outcomes considered, with exception to the neurological and musculoskeletal disease domains, and only varied slightly by sex. In summary, while the approximation of CA is important to consider when estimating BA, the strength of associations to prospective outcomes may be of greater importance. Hence, the context in which BA is estimated should be influenced by an investigator's specific research goals.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Spousal death is a common late-life event with health-related sequelae. Evidence linking poor mental health to disease suggests the hypothesis that poor mental health following death of a spouse could be a harbinger of physical health decline. Thus, identification of bereavement-related mental health symptoms could provide an opportunity for prevention.
METHODS: We analyzed data from N = 39,162 individuals followed from 1994 to 2016 in the U.S. Health and Retirement Study; N = 5,061 were widowed during follow-up. We tested change in mental and physical health from prebereavement through the 5 years following spousal death.
RESULTS: Bereaved spouses experienced an increase in depressive symptoms following their spouses' deaths but the depressive shock attenuated within 1 year. Bereaved spouses experienced increases in disability, chronic-disease morbidity, and hospitalization, which grew in magnitude over time, especially among older respondents. Bereaved spouses were at increased risk of death compared to nonbereaved respondents. The magnitude of depressive symptoms in the immediate aftermath of spousal death predicted physical-health decline and mortality risk over 5 years of follow-up.
DISCUSSION: Bereavement-related depressive symptoms indicate a risk for physical health decline and death in older adults. Screening for depressive symptoms in bereaved older adults may represent an opportunity for intervention to preserve healthy life span.},

We present a theoretical framework to help interpret analyses involving PGIs. A key insight is that a PGI can be understood as an unbiased but noisy measure of a latent variable we call the “additive SNP factor.” Regressions in which the true regressor is the additive SNP factor but the PGI is used as its proxy therefore suffer from errors-in-variables bias.

We conducted the pooled integrative data analysis (IDA) to combine data from four national population-based NIH longitudinal cohort studies that collectively cover multiple stages of the life course (Add Health, MIDUS, ACL, and HRS) and estimate mixed-effects models of age trajectories of BMI for men and women. We examined associations of BMI trajectories with birth cohort, race/ethnicity, parental education, and adult educational attainment. We found higher mean levels of and larger increases in BMI with age across more recent birth cohorts as compared with earlier-born cohorts. Black and Hispanic excesses in BMI compared with Whites were present early in life and persisted at all ages, and, in the case of Black-White disparities, were of larger magnitude for more recent cohorts. Higher parental and adulthood educational attainment were associated with lower levels of BMI at all ages. Women with college-educated parents also experienced less cohort increase in mean BMI. Both race and education disparities in BMI trajectories were larger for women compared with men.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Personality traits are linked with healthy aging, but it is not clear how these associations come to manifest across the life-course and across generations. To study this question, we tested a series of hypotheses about (a) personality-trait prediction of markers of healthy aging across the life-course, (b) developmental origins, stability and change of links between personality and healthy aging across time, and (c) intergenerational transmission of links between personality and healthy aging. For our analyses we used a measure that aggregates the contributions of Big 5 personality traits to healthy aging: a "vital personality" score.
METHODS: Data came from two population-based longitudinal cohort studies, one based in New Zealand and the other in the UK, comprising over 6000 study members across two generations, and spanning an age range from birth to late life.
RESULTS: Our analyses revealed three main findings: first, individuals with higher vital personality scores engaged in fewer health-risk behaviors, aged slower, and lived longer. Second, individuals' vital personality scores were preceded by differences in early-life temperament and were relatively stable across adulthood, but also increased from young adulthood to midlife. Third, individuals with higher vital personality scores had children with similarly vital partners, promoted healthier behaviors in their children, and had children who grew up to have more vital personality scores themselves, for genetic and environmental reasons.
CONCLUSION: Our study shows how the health benefits associated with personality accrue throughout the life-course and across generations.},

	abstract = {Caloric restriction (CR) improves markers of aging in humans; but it is not known if the fat mass and obesity-associated gene (FTO) rs9939609 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), which is associated with appetite and energy intake, influences adherence to prolonged CR. Utilizing data from the two-year Comprehensive Assessment of Long-term Effects of Reducing Intake of Energy (CALERIE™) phase 2 randomized controlled trial, we tested whether the FTO rs9939609 SNP was associated with adherence to CR in healthy adults without obesity. As secondary aims, we assessed whether the FTO rs9939609 SNP was associated with changes in body composition, biomarkers of aging, and eating behaviors. Participants were randomized into either a CR group that targeted a 25\% reduction in energy intake compared to the habitual energy intake at baseline, or an ad libitum (AL) control group. Participants were genotyped for the FTO rs9939609 SNP. Dietary adherence was determined through changes in energy intake using doubly labeled water and changes in body composition at baseline, month 12, and month 24 in both the CR and AL condition. Weight, body composition, resting metabolic rate (RMR), adiponectin, insulin, leptin, and eating behaviors were measured at the same timepoints. A total of 144 participants (91 CR and 53 AL, age: 38.6 ± 7.1 years; body mass index: 25.3 ± 1.7 kg/m2) were studied. Of these, 27 were homozygous for the 'obesity-risk' A allele (AA), while 44 were homozygous for the T allele (TT) and 73 were heterozygotes (AT). By design, the CR group exhibited greater percent CR compared to the AL group during the trial (P {\textless} 0.01), but no genotype-by-treatment interaction was observed for change in energy intake or percent CR (P ≥ 0.40). The FTO rs9939609 SNP was also negligibly associated with change in most other endpoints (P ≥ 0.13), though AAs showed a reduction in RMR adjusted for body composition change over the 24 months relative to TTs (genotype-by-treatment interaction: P = 0.03). In a two-year CR intervention delivered to healthy individuals without obesity, the FTO rs9939609 SNP was not associated with adherence to CR and did not alter improvements in most aging biomarkers.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To understand whether genetic risk for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is associated with the course of the disorder across childhood and into young adulthood.
METHOD: Participants were from the Environmental Risk (E-Risk) Longitudinal Twin Study, a population-based birth cohort of 2,232 twins. ADHD was assessed at ages 5, 7, 10, and 12 with mother- and teacher-reports and at age 18 with self-report. Polygenic risk scores (PRSs) were created using a genome-wide association study of ADHD case status. Associations with PRS were examined at multiple points in childhood and longitudinally from early childhood to adolescence. We investigated ADHD PRS and course to young adulthood, as reflected by ADHD remission, persistence, and late onset.
RESULTS: Participants with higher ADHD PRSs had increased risk for meeting ADHD diagnostic criteria (odds ratios ranging from 1.17 at age 10 to 1.54 at age 12) and for elevated symptoms at ages 5, 7, 10, and 12. Higher PRS was longitudinally associated with more hyperactivity/impulsivity (incidence rate ratio = 1.18) and inattention (incidence rate ratio = 1.14) from age 5 to age 12. In young adulthood, participants with persistent ADHD exhibited the highest PRS (mean PRS = 0.37), followed by participants with remission (mean PRS = 0.21); both groups had higher PRS than controls (mean PRS = -0.03), but did not significantly differ from one another. Participants with late-onset ADHD did not show elevated PRS for ADHD, depression, alcohol dependence, or marijuana use disorder.
CONCLUSION: Genetic risk scores derived from case-control genome-wide association studies may have relevance not only for incidence of mental health disorders, but also for understanding the longitudinal course of mental health disorders.},

METHODS: We followed N = 11 302 U.S. Health and Retirement Study participants aged 50-95 from 2006 to 2014 to measure persistence of experiences of loneliness and exposure to social isolation. We tested associations of longitudinal loneliness and social isolation phenotypes with disability, morbidity, mortality, and biological aging through 2018.
RESULTS: During follow-up, 18\% of older adults met criteria for loneliness, with 6\% meeting criteria at 2 or more follow-up assessments. For social isolation, these fractions were 21\% and 8\%. Health and Retirement Study participants who experienced loneliness and were exposed to social isolation were at increased risk for disease, disability, and mortality. Those experiencing persistent loneliness were at a 57\% increased hazard of mortality compared to those who never experienced loneliness. For social isolation, the increase was 28\%. Effect sizes were somewhat larger for counts of prevalent activity limitations and somewhat smaller for counts of prevalent chronic diseases. Covariate adjustment for socioeconomic and psychological risks attenuated but did not fully explain associations. Older adults who experienced loneliness and were exposed to social isolation also exhibited physiological indications of advanced biological aging (Cohen's d for persistent loneliness and social isolation = 0.26 and 0.21, respectively). For loneliness, but not social isolation, persistence was associated with increased risk.
CONCLUSIONS: Deficits in social connectedness prevalent in a national sample of U.S. older adults were associated with morbidity, disability, and mortality and with more advanced biological aging. Bolstering social connectedness to interrupt experiences of loneliness may promote healthy aging.},

Noncognitive genetics were enriched in the same brain tissues and cell types as cognitive performance, but showed different associations with gray-matter brain volumes.

For socioeconomic success and longevity, noncognitive and cognitive-performance genetics demonstrated associations of similar magnitude.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Occupational characteristics are associated with late-life cognition. However, little is known about the association between occupational factors and cognition in early adulthood, especially when controlling for early life socioeconomic status (SES) and cognition in childhood. Importantly, sex may shape the impact of occupational characteristics that provide cognitive stimulation given that education, occupational status, and workplace experiences differ by sex.
METHODS: Using data on 12,129 participants ages 24-32 from the U.S.-based National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health, we investigated the association between four factors of occupational cognitive stimulation (repetition, freedom, analytic skills, and social interaction) and young-adult episodic and working memory independent of childhood and young-adult SES, using linear regression. We adjusted for confounding due to sex, race/ethnicity, age, childhood cognition, and education. We further investigated effect measure modification of this association by sex in stratified regression models.
RESULTS: Overall, 1-unit increases in both occupational analytic skills and social interaction were significantly associated with 0.101 (95\%CI: 0.28, 0.173) and 0.096 (95\%CI: 0.032, 0.160) SD higher memory, respectively. However, when sex-stratified, among men, a 1-unit increase on the social interaction scale was associated with 0.16 (95\%CI: 0.05, 0.27) SD higher memory, while there was no association among women.
CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that even in adulthood, activities that stimulate the mind can contribute to improved cognitive function, and the most beneficial forms of occupational stimulation are those that use analytic skills and involve social interaction (particularly among young men).},

Here, we report a next-generation DNA-methylation biomarker of Pace of Aging, DunedinPACE (for Pace of Aging Calculated from the Epigenome). Methods:. We used data from the Dunedin Study 1972–1973 birth cohort tracking within-individual decline in 19 indicators of organ-system integrity across four time points spanning two decades to model Pace of Aging. We distilled this two-decade Pace of Aging into a single-time-point DNA-methylation blood-test using elastic-net regression and a DNA-methylation dataset restricted to exclude probes with low test-retest reliability. We evaluated the resulting measure, named DunedinPACE, in five additional datasets. Results:. DunedinPACE showed high test-retest reliability, was associated with morbidity, disability, and mortality, and indicated faster aging in young adults with childhood adversity. DunedinPACE effect-sizes were similar to GrimAge Clock effect-sizes. In analysis of incident morbidity, disability, and mortality, DunedinPACE and added incremental prediction beyond GrimAge. Conclusions:. DunedinPACE is a novel blood biomarker of the pace of aging for gerontology and geroscience. Funding:.

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The interplay between an individual's vulnerability and related stressors, effectively termed as diathesis, is an important contributor towards depressive symptoms. Utilizing the diathesis-stress model, the present study examines the role of perceived neighborhood safety along with specific indicators of health such as activities of daily living (ADL) and self-rated health (SRH), and their associations with depressive symptoms among older Indian adults.
STUDY DESIGN: A cross-sectional study has been conducted.
METHODS: Data were drawn from the Longitudinal Aging Study in India wave 1 that was collected during 2017-18. The present study is conducted on respondents aged 60 years and above and the sample included 31,464 older adults. Depressive symptoms were assessed using the Short Form Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI-SF).
RESULTS: In this study, approximately 14.3\% of the older participants reported perceiving their neighborhood as unsafe. A total of 23.77\% and 24.21\% of older adults reported at least one difficulty in ADL and poor SRH, respectively. Older adults who had perceived their neighborhood as unsafe had higher odds of reporting depressive symptoms [AOR: 1.758, CI: 1.497-2.066] than those with the perception of a safe neighborhood. Those with a perceived unsafe neighborhood and low ADL functioning had approximately 3.3 times higher odds of reporting depressive symptoms [AOR: 3.298, CI: 2.553-4.261] than those with a safe perceived neighborhood and high ADL functioning. Further, older adults with unsafe perceived neighborhood, low ADL functioning and poor SRH had much greater odds of reporting depressive symptoms [AOR: 7.725, CI: 5.443-10.960] than those with a safe perceived neighborhood, high ADL functioning and good SRH. Additionally, depressive symptoms were pronounced among older women and those who resided in rural areas with unsafe perceived neighborhood, low ADL functioning and poor SRH than their male peers.
CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that older women and rural-dwelling older adults are more prone to have higher prevalence of depressive symptoms than their male and urban-dwelling peers, especially when they have an unsafe neighborhood and poor functional and physical health, and thus, they should be given focused care and attention by healthcare practitioners.},

In addition, verbal short-term memory is associated with decelerated aging assessed with the new DNAm biomarker FitAgeAcceleration (ρ: − 0.18, p = 0.0017). DNAmFitAge can distinguish high-fitness individuals from low/medium-fitness individuals better than existing DNAm biomarkers and estimates a younger biological age in the high-fit males and females (1.5 and 2.0 years younger, respectively).

While longevity and lifespan aggregate in families, reflecting transmission of genes and environments across generations, little is known about intergenerational continuity of biological aging or the extent to which this continuity may be modified by environmental factors. Using data from the Jerusalem Perinatal Study (JPS), we tested if differences in offspring BA were related to mortality in their parents. We measured BA using biomarker data collected from 1473 offspring during clinical exams in 2007-2009, at age 32 ± 1.1. Parental mortality was obtained from population registry data for the years 2004-2016. We fitted parametric survival models to investigate the associations between offspring BA and parental all-cause and cause-specific mortality. We explored potential differences in these relationships by socioeconomic position (SEP) and offspring sex. Participants' BAs widely varied (SD = 6.95). Among those measured to be biologically older, parents had increased all-cause mortality (HR = 1.10, 95\% CI: 1.08, 1.13), diabetes mortality (HR = 1.19, 95\% CI: 1.08, 1.30), and cancer mortality (HR = 1.07, 95\% CI: 1.02, 1.13). The association with all-cause mortality was stronger for families with low compared with high SEP (Pinteraction = 0.04) and for daughters as compared to sons (Pinteraction {\textless} 0.001). Using a clinical-biomarker-based BA estimate, observable by young adulthood prior to the onset of aging-related diseases, we demonstrate intergenerational continuity of the aging process. Furthermore, variation in this familial aggregation according to household socioeconomic position (SEP) at offspring birth and between families of sons and daughters proposes that the environment alters individuals' aging trajectory set by their parents.},

	abstract = {AIM: To determine if genetic variation associated with decreased dopamine neurotransmission predicts a decrease in motor development in a convenience cohort study of infants born extremely-low-birthweight (ELBW).
METHOD: Four hundred and ninety-eight infants born ELBW had genome-wide genotyping and a neurodevelopmental evaluation at 18 to 22 months of age, corrected for preterm birth. A polygenic risk score (PRS) was created to combine into one predictor variable the hypothesized influences on motor development of alleles at seven independent single nucleotide polymorphisms previously associated with relative decreases in both dopamine neurotransmission and motor learning, by summing the number of alleles present in each infant (range=0-14). The motor development outcome was the Psychomotor Development Index (PDI) of the Bayley Scales of Infant Development, Second Edition. The linear regression models were adjusted for seven clinical and four genetic ancestry covariates. The mean PRS of infants with cerebral palsy (CP) was compared to those without CP.
RESULTS: PRS was inversely related to PDI (p=0.011). Each 1-point increase in PRS resulted in an average decrease in PDI of 1.37 points. Patients with CP did not have a greater mean PRS than those without (p=0.67), both with and without adjustment for covariates.
INTERPRETATION: Genetic variation that favors a decrease in dopamine neurotransmission predisposes to a decrease in motor development in infants born ELBW, but not to the diagnosis of CP.
WHAT THIS PAPER ADDS: Genetic variation in dopamine neurotransmission was associated with a decrease in motor development in infants born at an extremely-low-birthweight. It does not predispose to the diagnosis of cerebral palsy.},

To test such “geroprotective” therapies in humans, outcome measures are needed that can assess extension of disease-free life span. This need has spurred development of different methods to quantify biological aging. But different methods have not been systematically compared in the same humans. We implemented 7 methods to quantify biological aging using repeated-measures physiological and genomic data in 964 middle-aged humans in the Dunedin Study (New Zealand; persons born 1972–1973). We studied 11 measures in total: telomere-length and erosion, 3 epigenetic-clocks and their ticking rates, and 3 biomarker-composites. Contrary to expectation, we found low agreement between different measures of biological aging. We next compared associations between biological aging measures and outcomes that geroprotective therapies seek to modify: physical functioning, cognitive decline, and subjective signs of aging, including aged facial appearance. The 71–cytosine-phosphate-guanine epigenetic clock and biomarker composites were consistently related to these aging-related outcomes. However, effect sizes were modest. Results suggested that various proposed approaches to quantifying biological aging may not measure the same aspects of the aging process. Further systematic evaluation and refinement of measures of biological aging is needed to furnish outcomes for geroprotector trials.},

	abstract = {A summary genetic measure, called a "polygenic score," derived from a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of education can modestly predict a person's educational and economic success. This prediction could signal a biological mechanism: Education-linked genetics could encode characteristics that help people get ahead in life. Alternatively, prediction could reflect social history: People from well-off families might stay well-off for social reasons, and these families might also look alike genetically. A key test to distinguish biological mechanism from social history is if people with higher education polygenic scores tend to climb the social ladder beyond their parents' position. Upward mobility would indicate education-linked genetics encodes characteristics that foster success. We tested if education-linked polygenic scores predicted social mobility in {\textgreater}20,000 individuals in five longitudinal studies in the United States, Britain, and New Zealand. Participants with higher polygenic scores achieved more education and career success and accumulated more wealth. However, they also tended to come from better-off families. In the key test, participants with higher polygenic scores tended to be upwardly mobile compared with their parents. Moreover, in sibling-difference analysis, the sibling with the higher polygenic score was more upwardly mobile. Thus, education GWAS discoveries are not mere correlates of privilege; they influence social mobility within a life. Additional analyses revealed that a mother's polygenic score predicted her child's attainment over and above the child's own polygenic score, suggesting parents' genetics can also affect their children's attainment through environmental pathways. Education GWAS discoveries affect socioeconomic attainment through influence on individuals' family-of-origin environments and their social mobility.},

This has led to the hypothesis that genetics influence intelligence partly by contributing to the development of larger brains. We tested this hypothesis using four large imaging genetics studies (combined N = 7965) with polygenic scores derived from a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of educational attainment, a correlate of intelligence. We conducted meta-analysis to test associations among participants’ genetics, total brain volume (i.e., brain size), and cognitive test performance. Consistent with previous findings, participants with higher polygenic scores achieved higher scores on cognitive tests, as did participants with larger brains. Participants with higher polygenic scores also had larger brains. We found some evidence that brain size partly mediated associations between participants’ education polygenic scores and their cognitive test performance. Effect sizes were larger in the population-based samples than in the convenience-based samples. Recruitment and retention of population-representative samples should be a priority for neuroscience research.

We test this hypothesis by constructing polygenic scores for age at menarche and first birth using recently available genome-wide association study results and molecular genetic data on a sample of non-Hispanic white females from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health. We find that young women’s accelerated menarche polygenic scores are unrelated to their exposure to father absence. In contrast, polygenic scores for earlier age at first birth tend to be higher in young women raised in homes with absent fathers. Nevertheless, father absence and the polygenic scores independently and additively predict reproductive timing.

We analyze data from two biosocial surveys that contain both genetic data and follow students from secondary school through mid- to late life. We test if the magnitudes of the associations with educational and occupational attainments varied across the secondary schools that participants attended or with characteristics of those schools. Although we find little evidence that genetic associations with educational and occupational attainment varied across schools or with school characteristics, genetic associations with any postsecondary education and college completion were moderated by school-level socioeconomic status. Along similar lines, we observe substantial between-school variation in the average level of educational attainment students achieved for a fixed genotype. These findings emphasize the importance of social context in the interpretation of genetic associations. Specifically, our results suggest that though existing measures of individual genetic endowment have a linear relationship with years of schooling that is relatively consistent across school environments, school context is crucial in connecting an individual's genotype to his or her likelihood of crossing meaningful educational thresholds.},

For example, accelerated epigenetic age of blood is associated with higher risk of all-cause mortality in later life.

In this study, we therefore tested the hypothesis that an epigenetic predictor for biological age might be trained on face-age as a surrogate for biological age rather than on chronological age.

	abstract = {Background
Altered DNA methylation (DNAm) may be one pathway through which early-life adversity (ELA) contributes to adverse mental and physical health outcomes. This study investigated whether the presence versus absence of ELA experiences reflecting the dimensions of threat and deprivation were associated with epigenome-wide DNAm cross-sectionally and longitudinally in a community-based sample of children and adolescents.

Methods
In 113 youths aged 8–16 years with wide variability in ELA, we examined associations of abuse (physical, sexual, emotional; indicating threat-related experiences) and neglect (emotional, physical; indicating deprivation-related experiences) with DNAm assessed with the Illumina EPIC BeadChip array, with DNA derived from saliva. In cross-sectional epigenome-wide analyses, we investigated associations of lifetime abuse and neglect with DNAm at baseline. In longitudinal epigenome-wide analyses, we examined whether experiencing abuse and neglect over an approximately 2-year follow-up were each associated with change in DNAm from baseline to follow-up.

Results
In cross-sectional analyses adjusting for lifetime experience of neglect, lifetime experience of abuse was associated with DNAm for four cytosine-phosphodiester-guanine (CpG) sites (cg20241299: coefficient = 0.023, SE = 0.004; cg08671764: coefficient = 0.018, SE = 0.003; cg27152686: coefficient = − 0.069, SE = 0.012; cg24241897: coefficient = − 0.003, SE = 0.001; FDR {\textless} .05). In longitudinal analyses, experiencing neglect over follow-up was associated with an increase in DNAm for one CpG site, adjusting for abuse over follow-up (cg03135983: coefficient = 0.036, SE = 0.006; FDR {\textless} .05).

Conclusions
In this study, we identified examples of epigenetic patterns associated with ELA experiences of threat and deprivation that were already observable in youth. We provide novel evidence for change in DNAm over time in relation to ongoing adversity and that experiences reflecting distinct ELA dimensions may be characterized by unique epigenetic patterns.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Childhood risk factors are associated with elevated inflammatory biomarkers in adulthood, but it is unknown whether these risk factors are associated with increased adult levels of the chronic inflammation marker soluble urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (suPAR). We aimed to test the hypothesis that childhood exposure to risk factors for adult disease is associated with elevated suPAR in adulthood and to compare suPAR with the oft-reported inflammatory biomarker C-reactive protein (CRP).
METHODS: Prospective study of a population-representative 1972-1973 birth cohort; the Dunedin Multidisciplinary Health and Development Study observed participants to age 38 years. Main childhood predictors were poor health, socioeconomic disadvantage, adverse childhood experiences (ACEs), low IQ, and poor self-control. Main adult outcomes were adulthood inflammation measured as suPAR and high-sensitivity CRP (hsCRP).
RESULTS: Participants with available plasma samples at age 38 were included (N = 837, 50.5\% male). suPAR (mean 2.40 ng/ml; SD 0.91) was positively correlated with hsCRP (r 0.15, p {\textless} .001). After controlling for sex, body mass index (BMI), and smoking, children who experienced more ACEs, lower IQ, or had poorer self-control showed elevated adult suPAR. When the five childhood risks were aggregated into a Cumulative Childhood Risk index, and controlling for sex, BMI, and smoking, Cumulative Childhood Risk was associated with higher suPAR (b 0.10; SE 0.03; p = .002). Cumulative Childhood Risk predicted elevated suPAR, after controlling for hsCRP (b 0.18; SE 0.03; p {\textless} .001).
CONCLUSIONS: Exposure to more childhood risk factors was associated with higher suPAR levels, independent of CRP. suPAR is a useful addition to studies connecting childhood risk to adult inflammatory burden.},

New clinical studies of healthy ageing are needed and quantitative biomarkers are an essential component, particularly tools which can measure improvements in physiological integrity throughout life, thought to be a primary contributor to a long and productive life (a healthy "lifespan"). A framework for progress has recently been proposed in a WHO report which takes a broad, person-centered focus on healthy ageing, emphasizing the need to better understand an individual's intrinsic capacity, their functional abilities at various life stages, and the impact by mental, and physical health, and the environments they inhabit.},

	abstract = {Therapies to extend healthspan are poised to move from laboratory animal models to human clinical trials. Translation from mouse to human will entail challenges, among them the multifactorial heterogeneity of human aging. To inform clinical trials about this heterogeneity, we report how humans’ pace of biological aging relates to personal-history characteristics. Because geroprotective therapies must be delivered by midlife to prevent age-related disease onset, we studied young-adult members of the Dunedin Study 1972–73 birth cohort (n = 954). Cohort members’ Pace of Aging was measured as coordinated decline in the integrity of multiple organ systems, by quantifying rate of decline across repeated measurements of 18 biomarkers assayed when cohort members were ages 26, 32, and 38 years. The childhood personal-history characteristics studied were known predictors of age-related disease and mortality, and were measured prospectively during childhood. Personal-history characteristics of familial longevity, childhood social class, adverse childhood experiences, and childhood health, intelligence, and self-control all predicted differences in cohort members’ adulthood Pace of Aging. Accumulation of more personal-history risks predicted faster Pace of Aging. Because trials of anti-aging therapies will need to ascertain personal histories retrospectively, we replicated results using cohort members’ retrospective personal-history reports made in adulthood. Because many trials recruit participants from clinical settings, we replicated results in the cohort subset who had recent health system contact according to electronic medical records. Quick, inexpensive measures of trial participants’ early personal histories can enable clinical trials to study who volunteers for trials, who adheres to treatment, and who responds to anti-aging therapies.},

Several methods to measure biological aging show promise but it is not known if these methods are sensitive to changes caused by geroprotective therapy. We conducted analysis of two proposed methods to quantify biological aging using data from a recently concluded trial of an established geroprotector, caloric restriction. We obtained data from the National Institute on Aging CALERIE randomized trial through its public-access biobank (https://calerie.duke.edu/). The CALERIE trial randomized N = 220 nonobese adults to 25\% caloric restriction (n = 145; 11.7\% caloric restriction was achieved, on average) or to maintain current diet (n = 75) for 2 years. We analyzed biomarker data collected at baseline, 12-, and 24-month follow-up assessments. We applied published biomarker algorithms to these data to calculate two biological age measures, Klemera-Doubal Method Biological Age and homeostatic dysregulation. Intent-to-treat analysis using mixed-effects growth models of within-person change over time tested if caloric restriction slowed increase in measures of biological aging across follow-up. Analyses of both measures indicated caloric restriction slowed biological aging. Weight loss did not account for the observed effects.

	abstract = {Intervention studies in animals suggests molecular changes underlying age-related disease and disability can be slowed or reversed. To speed translation of these so-called “geroprotective” therapies to prevent age-related disease and disability in humans, biomarkers are needed that can track changes in the rate of human aging over the course of intervention trials. Algorithm methods that measure biological processes of aging from combinations of DNA methylation marks or clinical biomarkers show promise. To identify next steps for establishing utility of these algorithm-based measures of biological aging for geroprotector trials, we considered the history a candidate biomarker of aging that has received substantial research attention, telomere length. Although telomere length possesses compelling biology to recommend it as a biomarker of aging, mixed research findings have impeded clinical and epidemiologic translation. Strengths of telomeres that should be established for algorithm biomarkers of aging are correlation with chronological age across the lifespan, prediction of disease, disability, and early death, and responsiveness to risk and protective exposures. Key challenges in telomere research that algorithm biomarkers of aging must address are measurement precision and reliability, establishing links between longitudinal rates of change across repeated measurements and aging outcomes, and clarity over whether the biomarker is a causal mechanism of aging. These strengths and challenges suggest a research agenda to advance translation of algorithm-based aging biomarkers: establish validity in young-adult and midlife individuals; test responsiveness to exposures that shorten or extend healthy lifespan; conduct repeated-measures longitudinal studies to test differential rates of change.},

	doi = {10.1093/ije/dyx041},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Mortality selection occurs when a non-random subset of a population of interest has died before data collection and is unobserved in the data. Mortality selection is of general concern in the social and health sciences, but has received little attention in genetic epidemiology. We tested the hypothesis that mortality selection may bias genetic association estimates, using data from the US-based Health and Retirement Study (HRS).
METHODS: We tested mortality selection into the HRS genetic database by comparing HRS respondents who survive until genetic data collection in 2006 with those who do not. We next modelled mortality selection on demographic, health and social characteristics to calculate mortality selection probability weights. We analysed polygenic score associations with several traits before and after applying inverse-probability weighting to account for mortality selection. We tested simple associations and time-varying genetic associations (i.e. gene-by-cohort interactions).
RESULTS: We observed mortality selection into the HRS genetic database on demographic, health and social characteristics. Correction for mortality selection using inverse probability weighting methods did not change simple association estimates. However, using these methods did change estimates of gene-by-cohort interaction effects. Correction for mortality selection changed gene-by-cohort interaction estimates in the opposite direction from increased mortality selection based on analysis of HRS respondents surviving through 2012.
CONCLUSIONS: Mortality selection may bias estimates of gene-by-cohort interaction effects. Analyses of HRS data can adjust for mortality selection associated with observables by including probability weights. Mortality selection is a potential confounder of genetic association studies, but the magnitude of confounding varies by trait.},

	abstract = {Cognitive impairment has been identified as an important aspect of major depressive disorder (MDD). We tested two theories regarding the association between MDD and cognitive functioning using data from longitudinal cohort studies. One theory, the cognitive reserve hypothesis, suggests that higher cognitive ability in childhood decreases risk of later MDD. The second, the scarring hypothesis, instead suggests that MDD leads to persistent cognitive deficits following disorder onset. We tested both theories in the Dunedin Study, a population-representative cohort followed from birth to midlife and assessed repeatedly for both cognitive functioning and psychopathology. We also used data from the Environmental Risk Longitudinal Twin Study to test whether childhood cognitive functioning predicts future MDD risk independent of family-wide and genetic risk using a discordant twin design. Contrary to both hypotheses, we found that childhood cognitive functioning did not predict future risk of MDD, nor did study members with a past history of MDD show evidence of greater cognitive decline unless MDD was accompanied by other comorbid psychiatric conditions. Our results thus suggest that low cognitive functioning is related to comorbidity, but is neither an antecedent nor an enduring consequence of MDD. Future research may benefit from considering cognitive deficits that occur during depressive episodes from a transdiagnostic perspective.},

First, polygenic scores predicted adult economic outcomes even after accounting for educational attainments. Second, genes and environments were correlated: Children with higher polygenic scores were born into better-off homes. Third, children’s polygenic scores predicted their adult outcomes even when analyses accounted for their social-class origins; social-mobility analysis showed that children with higher polygenic scores were more upwardly mobile than children with lower scores. Fourth, polygenic scores predicted behavior across the life course, from early acquisition of speech and reading skills through geographic mobility and mate choice and on to financial planning for retirement. Fifth, polygenic-score associations were mediated by psychological characteristics, including intelligence, self-control, and interpersonal skill. Effect sizes were small.

	abstract = {As the population ages, the burden of disease from cognitive decline and dementing illness is rising. In the absence of treatments to reverse cognitive decline, prevention is a public health priority. Physical fitness and physical activity have emerged as prevention targets based on evidence of “neuroprotective” benefits in observational studies. However, observational studies linking active lifestyle with successful cognitive aging might be subject to bias from “neuroselection,” in which adults with better cognitive functioning are more likely to engage in healthy behaviors and avoid unhealthy ones. In their analysis of longitudinal data on several thousand children from the United Kingdom's Millennium Cohort Study, Aggio et al. (Am J Epidemiol. 2016;183(12):1075–1082) revealed that this pattern of neuroselection is already apparent in childhood. However, they also report data that suggest there are cognitive benefits to engaging in certain types of active behaviors over and above this selection. Their findings argue for greater attention to confounding by neuroselection in research on cognitive aging, and they suggest the possibility that early interventions to promote certain health behaviors may instill a virtuous cycle with benefits that accumulate across the lifespan.},

	abstract = {Genome-wide association studies  have identified genetic risks for obesity. These genetic risks influence development of obesity partly by accelerating weight gain in childhood. Research is needed to identify mechanisms to inform intervention. Cross-sectional studies suggest appetite traits as a candidate mechanism. Longitudinal studies are needed to test whether appetite traits mediate genetic influences on children’s weight gain.To test whether genetic risk for obesity predicts accelerated weight gain in middle childhood (ages 4-8 years) and whether genetic association with accelerated weight gain is mediated by appetite traits.Longitudinal study of a representative birth cohort at the Trondheim Early Secure Study, Trondheim, Norway, enrolled at age 4 years during 2007 to 2008, with follow-ups at ages 6 and 8 years. Participants were sampled from all children born in 2003 or 2004 who attended regular community health checkups for 4-year-olds (97.2\% attendance; 82.0\% consent rate, n = 2475). Nine hundred ninety-five children participated at age 4 years, 795 at age 6 years, and 699 at age 8 years. Analyses included 652 children with genotype, adiposity, and appetite data.Outcomes were body mass index and body-fat phenotypes measured from anthropometry (ages 4, 6, and 8 years) and bioelectrical impedance (ages 6 and 8 years). Genetic risk for obesity was measured using a genetic risk score composed of 32 single-nucleotide polymorphisms previously discovered in genome-wide association studies of adult body mass index. Appetite traits were measured at age 6 years with the Children’s Eating Behavior Questionnaire.Of the 652 genotyped child participants, 323 (49.5\%) were female, 58 (8.9\%) were overweight, and 1 (0.2\%) was obese. Children at higher genetic risk for obesity had higher baseline body mass index and fat mass compared with lower genetic risk peers, and they gained weight and fat mass more rapidly during follow-up. Each SD increase in genetic risk score was associated with a 0.22-point increase in BMI at age-4 baseline (for the intercept, unstandardized path coefficient B = 0.22 [95\% CI, 0.06-0.38]; P = .008. Children with higher genetic risk scores also gained BMI points more rapidly from ages 4 to 6 years (B = 0.11 [95\% CI, 0.03-0.20]; P = .01 ; β = 0.12) and from 6 to 8 years (B = 0.09 [95\% CI, 0.00-0.19]; P = .05; β = 0.10), compared with their lower genetic risk peers. Children at higher genetic risk had higher levels of alleged obesogenic appetite traits than peers with lower genetic risk at age 6 years, but appetite traits did not mediate genetic associations with weight gain. The sum of the 5 indirect effects was B = −0.001 (95\% CI, −0.02 -0.01); P = .86; β = 0.00. Genetic risk for obesity is associated with accelerated childhood weight gain. Interventions targeting childhood weight gain may provide one path to mitigating genetic risk. However, middle childhood appetite traits may not be a promising target for such interventions. Studies of early-childhood samples are needed to test whether appetite traits explain how genetic risks accelerate growth earlier in development.},

(ii) Has the genetic covariance between fitness (as measured by total fertility) and other traits changed over time? The answers to these questions inform our understanding of how the genetic landscape of American society has changed over the past century and have implications for population trends. We show that husbands and wives carry similar loadings for genetic factors related to education and height. However, the magnitude of this similarity is modest and has been fairly consistent over the course of the 20th century. This consistency is particularly notable in the case of education, for which phenotypic similarity among spouses has increased in recent years. Likewise, changing patterns of the number of children ever born by phenotype are not matched by shifts in genotype-fertility relationships over time. Taken together, these trends provide no evidence that social sorting is becoming increasingly genetic in nature or that dysgenic dynamics have accelerated.},

We integrated multiple nationwide administrative databases and electronic medical records with the four-decade Dunedin birth-cohort study to test child-to-adult prediction in a different way, by using a population-segmentation approach. A segment comprising one-fifth of the cohort accounted for 36\% of the cohort's injury insurance-claims; 40\% of excess obese-kilograms; 54\% of cigarettes smoked; 57\% of hospital nights; 66\% of welfare benefits; 77\% of fatherless childrearing; 78\% of prescription fills; and 81\% of criminal convictions.

Surprisingly, compared to this modal group, never-diagnosed Study members were not born into unusually well-to-do families, nor did their enduring mental health follow markedly sound physical health, or unusually high intelligence. Instead, they tended to have an advantageous temperament/personality style, and negligible family history of mental disorder. As adults, they report superior educational and occupational attainment, greater life satisfaction, and higher-quality relationships.

METHOD: A representative birth cohort of 2,232 children was followed to age 18 years as part of the Environmental Risk Longitudinal Twin Study. Childhood bullying victimization was reported by mothers and children during primary school and early secondary school. At the age-18 follow-up, we assessed a categorical measure of overweight, body mass index, and waist-hip ratio. Indicators of overweight were also collected at ages 10 and 12. Co-twin body mass and birth weight were used to index genetic and fetal liability to overweight, respectively.
RESULTS: Bullied children were more likely to be overweight than non-bullied children at age 18, and this association was (1) strongest in chronically bullied children (odds ratio = 1.69; 95\% confidence interval [CI] = 1.21-2.35); (2) consistent across measures of overweight (body mass index: b = 1.12; 95\% CI = 0.37-1.87; waist-hip ratio: b = 1.76; 95\% CI = 0.84-2.69); (3) specific to bullying and not explained by co-occurring maltreatment; (4) independent of child socioeconomic status, food insecurity, mental health, and cognition, and pubertal development; and (5) not present at the time of bullying victimization, and independent of childhood weight and genetic and fetal liability.
CONCLUSION: Childhood bullying victimization predicts overweight in young adulthood.},

We created a universal screening tool that incorporates these features to identify adolescents at risk for persistent substance dependence in adulthood.
METHOD: Participants were members of a representative cohort of 1037 individuals born in Dunedin, New Zealand in 1972-1973 and followed prospectively to age 38 years, with 95\% retention. We assessed a small set of childhood and adolescent risk factors: family history of substance dependence, childhood psychopathology (conduct disorder, depression), early exposure to substances, frequent substance use in adolescence, sex, and childhood socioeconomic status. We defined the outcome (persistent substance dependence in adulthood) as dependence on one or more of alcohol, tobacco, cannabis, or hard drugs at ⩾3 assessment ages: 21, 26, 32, and 38 years.
RESULTS: A cumulative risk index, a simple sum of nine childhood and adolescent risk factors, predicted persistent substance dependence in adulthood with considerable accuracy (AUC = 0.80).
CONCLUSIONS: A cumulative risk score can accurately predict which adolescents in the general population will develop persistent substance dependence in adulthood.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs; e.g. abuse, neglect, and parental loss) have been associated with increased risk for later-life disease and dysfunction using adults' retrospective self-reports of ACEs. Research should test whether associations between ACEs and health outcomes are the same for prospective and retrospective ACE measures.
METHODS: We estimated agreement between ACEs prospectively recorded throughout childhood (by Study staff at Study member ages 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, and 15) and retrospectively recalled in adulthood (by Study members when they reached age 38), in the population-representative Dunedin cohort (N = 1,037). We related both retrospective and prospective ACE measures to physical, mental, cognitive, and social health at midlife measured through both objective (e.g. biomarkers and neuropsychological tests) and subjective (e.g. self-reported) means.
RESULTS: Dunedin and U.S. Centers for Disease Control ACE distributions were similar. Retrospective and prospective measures of adversity showed moderate agreement (r = .47, p {\textless} .001; weighted Kappa = .31, 95\% CI: .27-.35). Both associated with all midlife outcomes. As compared to prospective ACEs, retrospective ACEs showed stronger associations with life outcomes that were subjectively assessed, and weaker associations with life outcomes that were objectively assessed. Recalled ACEs and poor subjective outcomes were correlated regardless of whether prospectively recorded ACEs were evident. Individuals who recalled more ACEs than had been prospectively recorded were more neurotic than average, and individuals who recalled fewer ACEs than recorded were more agreeable.
CONCLUSIONS: Prospective ACE records confirm associations between childhood adversity and negative life outcomes found previously using retrospective ACE reports. However, more agreeable and neurotic dispositions may, respectively, bias retrospective ACE measures toward underestimating the impact of adversity on objectively measured life outcomes and overestimating the impact of adversity on self-reported outcomes. Associations between personality factors and the propensity to recall adversity were extremely modest and warrant further investigation. Risk predictions based on retrospective ACE reports should utilize objective outcome measures. Where objective outcome measurements are difficult to obtain, correction factors may be warranted.},

	abstract = {Objective A study was undertaken to determine whether better cognitive functioning at midlife among more physically fit individuals reflects neuroprotection, by which fitness protects against age-related cognitive decline, or neuroselection, by which children with higher cognitive functioning select more active lifestyles. Methods Children in the Dunedin Longitudinal Study (N = 1,037) completed the Wechsler Intelligence Scales and the Trail Making, Rey Delayed Recall, and Grooved Pegboard tasks as children and again at midlife (age = 38 years). Adult cardiorespiratory fitness was assessed using a submaximal exercise test to estimate maximum oxygen consumption adjusted for body weight in milliliters/minute/kilogram. We tested whether more fit individuals had better cognitive functioning than their less fit counterparts (which could be consistent with neuroprotection), and whether better childhood cognitive functioning predisposed to better adult cardiorespiratory fitness (neuroselection). Finally, we examined possible mechanisms of neuroselection. Results Participants with better cardiorespiratory fitness had higher cognitive test scores at midlife. However, fitness-associated advantages in cognitive functioning were already present in childhood. After accounting for childhood baseline performance on the same cognitive tests, there was no association between cardiorespiratory fitness and midlife cognitive functioning. Socioeconomic and health advantages in childhood and healthier lifestyles during young adulthood explained most of the association between childhood cognitive functioning and adult cardiorespiratory fitness. Interpretation We found no evidence for a neuroprotective effect of cardiorespiratory fitness as of midlife. Instead, children with better cognitive functioning are selecting healthier lives. Fitness interventions may enhance cognitive functioning. However, observational and experimental studies testing neuroprotective effects of physical fitness should consider confounding by neuroselection. Ann Neurol 2015;77:607–617},

Children who carried copies of the A-allele of the single-nucleotide polymorphism rs10482672 had the highest risk of externalizing psychopathology if they were in the control arm of the trial and the lowest risk of externalizing psychopathology if they were in the treatment arm. In this study, we test a developmental hypothesis about the origins of this for-better-and-for-worse gene-by-intervention interaction (GxI): That the observed GxI effect on adult psychopathology is mediated by the proximal impact of intervention on childhood externalizing problems and adolescent substance use and delinquency. We analyzed longitudinal data tracking the 270 European-American children in the Fast Track RCT with available genetic information (129 intervention children and 141 control-group peers, 69\% male) from kindergarten through age 25 years. Results show that the same pattern of “for-better-and-for-worse” susceptibility to intervention observed at the age-25 follow-up was evident already during childhood. At the elementary school follow-ups and at the middle/high-school follow-ups, rs10482672 predicted better adjustment among children receiving the Fast Track intervention, and worse adjustment among children in the control condition. In turn, these proximal GxI effects early in development mediated the ultimate GxI effect on externalizing psychopathology at age 25 years. We discuss the contribution of these findings to the growing literature on genetic susceptibility to environmental intervention.},

	abstract = {Early interventions are a preferred method for addressing behavioral problems in high-risk children, but often have only modest effects. Identifying sources of variation in intervention effects can suggest means to improve efficiency. One potential source of such variation is the genome. We conducted a genetic analysis of the Fast Track randomized control trial, a 10-year-long intervention to prevent high-risk kindergarteners from developing adult externalizing problems including substance abuse and antisocial behavior. We tested whether variants of the glucocorticoid receptor gene NR3C1 were associated with differences in response to the Fast Track intervention. We found that in European-American children, a variant of NR3C1 identified by the single-nucleotide polymorphism rs10482672 was associated with increased risk for externalizing psychopathology in control group children and decreased risk for externalizing psychopathology in intervention group children. Variation in NR3C1 measured in this study was not associated with differential intervention response in African-American children. We discuss implications for efforts to prevent externalizing problems in high-risk children and for public policy in the genomic era.},

This finding suggests that intelligence might influence mortality through its effects on a general process of physiological deterioration (i.e., individual variation in "biological age"). We examined whether intelligence could predict measures of aging at midlife before the onset of most age-related disease.
METHODS: We tested whether intelligence assessed in early childhood, middle childhood, and midlife predicted midlife biological age in members of the Dunedin Study, a population-representative birth cohort.
RESULTS: Lower intelligence predicted more advanced biological age at midlife as captured by perceived facial age, a 10-biomarker algorithm based on data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), and Framingham heart age (r = 0.1-0.2). Correlations between intelligence and telomere length were less consistent. The associations between intelligence and biological age were not explained by differences in childhood health or parental socioeconomic status, and intelligence remained a significant predictor of biological age even when intelligence was assessed before Study members began their formal schooling.
DISCUSSION: These results suggest that accelerated aging may serve as one of the factors linking low early-life intelligence to increased rates of morbidity and mortality.},

	abstract = {Rationale: Asthma is prospectively associated with age-related chronic diseases and mortality, suggesting the hypothesis that asthma may relate to a general, multisystem phenotype of accelerated aging.

Objectives: To test whether chronic asthma is associated with a proposed biomarker of accelerated aging, leukocyte telomere length.

Methods: Asthma was ascertained prospectively in the Dunedin Multidisciplinary Health and Development Study cohort (n = 1,037) at nine in-person assessments spanning ages 9–38 years. Leukocyte telomere length was measured at ages 26 and 38 years. Asthma was classified as life-course-persistent, childhood-onset not meeting criteria for persistence, and adolescent/adult-onset. We tested associations between asthma and leukocyte telomere length using regression models. We tested for confounding of asthma-leukocyte telomere length associations using covariate adjustment. We tested serum C-reactive protein and white blood cell counts as potential mediators of asthma-leukocyte telomere length associations.

Measurements and Main Results: Study members with life-course-persistent asthma had shorter leukocyte telomere length as compared with sex- and age-matched peers with no reported asthma. In contrast, leukocyte telomere length in study members with childhood-onset and adolescent/adult-onset asthma was not different from leukocyte telomere length in peers with no reported asthma. Adjustment for life histories of obesity and smoking did not change results. Study members with life-course-persistent asthma had elevated blood eosinophil counts. Blood eosinophil count mediated 29\% of the life-course-persistent asthma-leukocyte telomere length association.

Conclusions: Life-course-persistent asthma is related to a proposed biomarker of accelerated aging, possibly via systemic eosinophilic inflammation. Life histories of asthma can inform studies of aging.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Despite a prevailing assumption that adult ADHD is a childhood-onset neurodevelopmental disorder, no prospective longitudinal study has described the childhoods of the adult ADHD population. The authors report follow-back analyses of ADHD cases diagnosed in adulthood, alongside follow-forward analyses of ADHD cases diagnosed in childhood, in one cohort.
METHOD: Participants belonged to a representative birth cohort of 1,037 individuals born in Dunedin, New Zealand, in 1972 and 1973 and followed to age 38, with 95\% retention. Symptoms of ADHD, associated clinical features, comorbid disorders, neuropsychological deficits, genome-wide association study-derived polygenic risk, and life impairment indicators were assessed. Data sources were participants, parents, teachers, informants, neuropsychological test results, and administrative records. Adult ADHD diagnoses used DSM-5 criteria, apart from onset age and cross-setting corroboration, which were study outcome measures.
RESULTS: As expected, childhood ADHD had a prevalence of 6\% (predominantly male) and was associated with childhood comorbid disorders, neurocognitive deficits, polygenic risk, and residual adult life impairment. Also as expected, adult ADHD had a prevalence of 3\% (gender balanced) and was associated with adult substance dependence, adult life impairment, and treatment contact. Unexpectedly, the childhood ADHD and adult ADHD groups comprised virtually nonoverlapping sets; 90\% of adult ADHD cases lacked a history of childhood ADHD. Also unexpectedly, the adult ADHD group did not show tested neuropsychological deficits in childhood or adulthood, nor did they show polygenic risk for childhood ADHD.
CONCLUSIONS: The findings raise the possibility that adults presenting with the ADHD symptom picture may not have a childhood-onset neurodevelopmental disorder. If this finding is replicated, then the disorder's place in the classification system must be reconsidered, and research must investigate the etiology of adult ADHD.},

In this article, we outline why now is the time for social scientists to bring genetics into their research programs. We discuss how to select genetic variants to study. We explain how the polygenic architecture of complex traits and the low penetrance of individual genetic loci pose challenges to research integrating genetics and social science.

Credit scoring has been so successful that it has expanded beyond lending and into our everyday lives, even to inform how insurers evaluate our health. The pervasive application of credit scoring has outpaced knowledge about why credit scores are such useful indicators of individual behavior. Here we test if the same factors that lead to poor credit scores also lead to poor health. Following the Dunedin (New Zealand) Longitudinal Study cohort of 1,037 study members, we examined the association between credit scores and cardiovascular disease risk and the underlying factors that account for this association. We find that credit scores are negatively correlated with cardiovascular disease risk. Variation in household income was not sufficient to account for this association. Rather, individual differences in human capital factors—educational attainment, cognitive ability, and self-control—predicted both credit scores and cardiovascular disease risk and accounted for ∼45\% of the correlation between credit scores and cardiovascular disease risk. Tracing human capital factors back to their childhood antecedents revealed that the characteristic attitudes, behaviors, and competencies children develop in their first decade of life account for a significant portion (∼22\%) of the link between credit scores and cardiovascular disease risk at midlife. We discuss the implications of these findings for policy debates about data privacy, financial literacy, and early childhood interventions.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            Consistent with findings from experimental research in nonhuman primates exposed to early-life stress, children exposed to maltreatment are at high risk of detrimental physical health conditions, such as obesity and systemic inflammation. Because leptin is a key molecule involved in the regulation of both energy balance and immunity, we investigated abnormalities in leptin physiology among maltreated children. We measured leptin, body mass index and C-reactive protein in 170 12-year-old children members of the Environmental-Risk Longitudinal Twin Study, for whom we had prospectively-collected information on maltreatment exposure. We found that maltreated children exhibited blunted elevation in leptin levels in relation to increasing levels of physiological stimuli, adiposity and inflammation, compared with a group of non-maltreated children matched for gender, zygosity and socioeconomic status. These findings were also independent of key potential artifacts and confounders, such as time of day at sample collection, history of food insecurity, pubertal maturation and depressive symptoms. Furthermore, using birth weight as a proxy measure for leptin, we found that physiological abnormalities were presumably not present at birth in children who went on to be maltreated but only emerged over the course of childhood, after maltreatment exposure. Leptin deficiency may contribute to onset, persistence and progression of physical health problems in maltreated children.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Perinatal complications predict increased risk for morbidity and early mortality. Evidence of perinatal programming of adult mortality raises the question of what mechanisms embed this long-term effect. We tested a hypothesis related to the theory of developmental origins of health and disease: that perinatal complications assessed at birth predict indicators of accelerated aging by midlife.
METHODS: Perinatal complications, including both maternal and neonatal complications, were assessed in the Dunedin Multidisciplinary Health and Development Study cohort (N = 1037), a 38-year, prospective longitudinal study of a representative birth cohort. Two aging indicators were assessed at age 38 years, objectively by leukocyte telomere length (TL) and subjectively by perceived facial age.
RESULTS: Perinatal complications predicted both leukocyte TL (β = -0.101; 95\% confidence interval, -0.169 to -0.033; P = .004) and perceived age (β = 0.097; 95\% confidence interval, 0.029 to 0.165; P = .005) by midlife. We repeated analyses with controls for measures of family history and social risk that could predispose to perinatal complications and accelerated aging, and for measures of poor health taken in between birth and the age-38 follow-up. These covariates attenuated, but did not fully explain the associations observed between perinatal complications and aging indicators.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings provide support for early-life developmental programming by linking newborns' perinatal complications to accelerated aging at midlife. We observed indications of accelerated aging "inside," as measured by leukocyte TL, an indicator of cellular aging, and "outside," as measured by perceived age, an indicator of declining tissue integrity. A better understanding of mechanisms underlying perinatal programming of adult aging is needed.},

The GRS predicted differences in obesity risk net of demographic, geographic, and socioeconomic information. The GRS performed less well among African Americans. The genetic risk score we derived from GWAS provides a molecular measurement of genetic predisposition to elevated BMI and obesity.[Supplemental materials are available for this article.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have discovered genetic variants that predispose individuals to asthma. To integrate these new discoveries with emerging models of asthma pathobiology, we aimed to test how genetic discoveries relate to developmental and biological characteristics of asthma.
METHODS: In this prospective longitudinal study, we investigated a multilocus profile of genetic risk derived from published GWAS of asthma case status. We then tested associations between this genetic risk score and developmental and biological characteristics of asthma in participants enrolled in a population-based long-running birth cohort, the Dunedin Multidisciplinary Health and Development Study (n=1037). We used data on asthma onset, asthma persistence, atopy, airway hyper-responsiveness, incompletely reversible airflow obstruction, and asthma-related school and work absenteeism and hospital admissions obtained during nine prospective assessments spanning the ages of 9 to 38 years. Analyses included cohort members of European descent from whom genetic data had been obtained.
FINDINGS: Of the 880 cohort members included in our analysis, those at higher genetic risk developed asthma earlier in life than did those with lower genetic risk (hazard ratio [HR] 1·12, 95\% CI 1·01-1·26). Of cohort members with childhood-onset asthma, those with higher genetic risk were more likely to develop life-course-persistent asthma than were those with a lower genetic risk (relative risk [RR] 1·36, 95\% CI 1·14-1·63). Participants with asthma at higher genetic risk more often had atopy (RR 1·07, 1·01-1·14), airway hyper-responsiveness (RR 1·16, 1·03-1·32), and incompletely reversible airflow obstruction (RR 1·28, 1·04-1·57) than did those with a lower genetic risk. They were also more likely to miss school or work (incident rate ratio 1·38, 1·02-1·86) and be admitted to hospital (HR 1·38, 1·07-1·79) because of asthma. Genotypic information about asthma risk was independent of and additive to information derived from cohort members' family histories of asthma.
INTERPRETATION: Our findings confirm that GWAS discoveries for asthma are associated with a childhood-onset phenotype. Genetic risk assessments might be able to predict which childhood-onset asthma cases remit and which become life-course-persistent, who might develop impaired lung function, and the burden of asthma in terms of missed school and work and hospital admissions, although these predictions are not sufficiently sensitive or specific to support immediate clinical translation.

The genetic risk score was composed of single-nucleotide polymorphisms identified in 3 meta-analyses of genome-wide association studies of smoking quantity phenotypes.Smoking initiation, conversion to daily smoking, progression to heavy smoking, nicotine dependence (Fagerström Test of Nicotine Dependence), and cessation difficulties were evaluated at 8 assessments spanning the ages of 11 to 38 years.Genetic risk score was unrelated to smoking initiation. However, individuals at higher genetic risk were more likely to convert to daily smoking as teenagers, progressed more rapidly from smoking initiation to heavy smoking, persisted longer in smoking heavily, developed nicotine dependence more frequently, were more reliant on smoking to cope with stress, and were more likely to fail in their cessation attempts. Further analysis revealed that 2 adolescent developmental phenotypes—early conversion to daily smoking and rapid progression to heavy smoking—mediated associations between the genetic risk score and mature phenotypes of persistent heavy smoking, nicotine dependence, and cessation failure. The genetic risk score predicted smoking risk over and above family history.Initiatives that disrupt the developmental progression of smoking behavior among adolescents may mitigate genetic risks for developing adult smoking problems. Future genetic research may maximize discovery potential by focusing on smoking behavior soon after smoking initiation and by studying young smokers.},

Intelligence quotient (IQ) was measured in childhood and adulthood. Anthropometric measurements were taken at birth and at 12 subsequent in-person assessments. As expected, cohort members who became obese had lower adulthood IQ scores. However, obese cohort members exhibited no excess decline in IQ. Instead, these cohort members had lower IQ scores since childhood. This pattern remained consistent when we accounted for children's birth weights and growth during the first years of life, as well as for childhood-onset obesity. Lower IQ scores among children who later developed obesity were present as early as 3 years of age. We observed no evidence that obesity contributed to a decline in IQ, even among obese individuals who displayed evidence of the metabolic syndrome and/or elevated systemic inflammation.},

Physicians will face more young adult patients, which presents an opportunity for more prevention-oriented care. In the present study, we evaluated whether brief observer reports of young adults' personality traits could predict which individuals would be at greater risk for poor health as they entered midlife. Following the cohort of 1,000 individuals from the Dunedin Multidisciplinary Health and Development Study (Moffitt, Caspi, Rutter, \& Silva, 2001), we show that very brief measures of young adults' personalities predicted their midlife physical health across multiple domains (metabolic abnormalities, cardiorespiratory fitness, pulmonary function, periodontal disease, and systemic inflammation). Individuals scoring low on the traits of Conscientiousness and Openness to Experience went on to develop poorer health even after accounting for preexisting differences in education, socioeconomic status, smoking, obesity, self-reported health, medical conditions, and family medical history. Moreover, personality ratings from peer informants who knew participants well, and from a nurse and receptionist who had just met participants for the first time, predicted health decline from young adulthood to midlife despite striking differences in level of acquaintance. Personality effect sizes were on par with other well-established health risk factors such as socioeconomic status, smoking, and self-reported health. We discuss the potential utility of personality measurement to function as an inexpensive and accessible tool for health care professionals to personalize preventive medicine. Adding personality information to existing health care electronic infrastructures could also advance personality theory by generating opportunities to examine how personality processes influence doctor-patient communication, health service use, and patient outcomes.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Retinal and cerebral microvessels are structurally and functionally homologous, but unlike cerebral microvessels, retinal microvessels can be noninvasively measured in vivo by retinal imaging. The authors tested the hypothesis that individuals with schizophrenia exhibit microvascular abnormality and evaluated the utility of retinal imaging as a tool for schizophrenia research.
METHOD: Participants were members of the Dunedin Study, a population-representative cohort followed from birth with 95\% retention. Study members underwent retinal imaging at age 38. The authors assessed retinal arteriolar and venular caliber for all members of the cohort, including individuals who developed schizophrenia.
RESULTS: Study members who developed schizophrenia were distinguished by wider retinal venules, suggesting microvascular abnormality reflective of insufficient brain oxygen supply. Analyses that controlled for confounding health conditions suggested that wider retinal venules are not simply an artifact of co-occurring health problems in schizophrenia patients. Wider venules were also associated with a dimensional measure of adult psychosis symptoms and with psychosis symptoms reported in childhood.
CONCLUSIONS: The findings provide initial support for the hypothesis that individuals with schizophrenia show microvascular abnormality. Moreover, the results suggest that the same vascular mechanisms underlie subthreshold symptoms and clinical disorder and that these associations may begin early in life.

Past-year DSM-IV alcohol dependence diagnoses are ascertained with structured diagnostic interviews at ages 18, 21, 26, and 32. Individuals are classified as developmentally limited, persistent, or adult-onset subtypes based on their time-ordered pattern of diagnoses. The persistent subtype generally exhibits the worst scores on all correlates, including family psychiatric history, adolescent and adult externalizing and internalizing problems, adolescent and adult substance use, adult quality of life, and coping strategies. The prospective predictors that distinguished them from the developmentally limited subtype involved family liability, adolescent negative affectivity, daily alcohol use, and frequent marijuana use. Furthermore, young people who develop the persistent subtype of alcohol dependence are distinguished from the developmentally limited subtype by an inability to reduce drinking and by continued use despite problems by age 18. The adult-onset group members are virtually indistinguishable from ordinary cohort members as children or adolescents; however, in adulthood, adult-onset cases are distinguished by problems with depression, substance use, stress, and strategies for coping with stress. Information about age of onset and developmental course is fundamental for identifying subtypes of alcohol dependence. Subtype-specific etiologies point to targeted prevention and intervention efforts based on the characteristics of each subtype.},

DESIGN: A 38-year prospective longitudinal study of a representative birth cohort.
SETTING: The Dunedin Multidisciplinary Health and Development Study, Dunedin, New Zealand.
PARTICIPANTS: One thousand thirty-seven male and female study members.
MAIN EXPOSURES: We assessed genetic risk with a multilocus genetic risk score. The genetic risk score was composed of single-nucleotide polymorphisms identified in genome-wide association studies of obesity-related phenotypes. We assessed family history from parent body mass index data collected when study members were 11 years of age.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Body mass index growth curves, developmental phenotypes of obesity, and adult obesity outcomes were defined from anthropometric assessments at birth and at 12 subsequent in-person interviews through 38 years of age.
RESULTS: Individuals with higher genetic risk scores were more likely to be chronically obese in adulthood. Genetic risk first manifested as rapid growth during early childhood. Genetic risk was unrelated to birth weight. After birth, children at higher genetic risk gained weight more rapidly and reached adiposity rebound earlier and at a higher body mass index. In turn, these developmental phenotypes predicted adult obesity, mediating about half the genetic effect on adult obesity risk. Genetic associations with growth and obesity risk were independent of family history, indicating that the genetic risk score could provide novel information to clinicians.
CONCLUSIONS: Genetic variation linked with obesity risk operates, in part, through accelerating growth in the early childhood years after birth. Etiological research and prevention strategies should target early childhood to address the obesity epidemic.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To test whether frequent bullying victimisation in childhood increases the likelihood of self harming in early adolescence, and to identify which bullied children are at highest risk of self harm.
DESIGN: The Environmental Risk (E-Risk) longitudinal study of a nationally representative UK cohort of 1116 twin pairs born in 1994-95 (2232 children).
SETTING: England and Wales, United Kingdom.
PARTICIPANTS: Children assessed at 5, 7, 10, and 12 years of age.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Relative risks of children's self harming behaviour in the six months before their 12th birthday.
RESULTS: Self harm data were available for 2141 children. Among children aged 12 who had self harmed (2.9\%; n=62), more than half were victims of frequent bullying (56\%; n=35). Exposure to frequent bullying predicted higher rates of self harm even after children's pre-morbid emotional and behavioural problems, low IQ, and family environmental risks were taken into account (bullying victimisation reported by mother: adjusted relative risk 1.92, 95\% confidence interval 1.18 to 3.12; bullying victimisation reported by child: 2.44, 1.36 to 4.40). Victimised twins were more likely to self harm than were their non-victimised twin sibling (bullying victimisation reported by mother: 13/162 v 3/162, ratio=4.3, 95\% confidence interval 1.3 to 14.0; bullying victimisation reported by child: 12/144 v 7/144, ratio=1.7, 0.71 to 4.1). Compared with bullied children who did not self harm, bullied children who self harmed were distinguished by a family history of attempted/completed suicide, concurrent mental health problems, and a history of physical maltreatment by an adult.
CONCLUSIONS: Prevention of non-suicidal self injury in young adolescents should focus on helping bullied children to cope more appropriately with their distress. Programmes should target children who have additional mental health problems, have a family history of attempted/completed suicide, or have been maltreated by an adult.},

It is not clear whether borderline personality related characteristics in children share etiological features with adult borderline personality disorder. We investigated the etiology of borderline personality related characteristics in a longitudinal cohort study of 1,116 pairs of same-sex twins followed from birth through age 12 years. Borderline personality related characteristics measured at age 12 years were highly heritable, were more common in children who had exhibited poor cognitive function, impulsivity, and more behavioral and emotional problems at age 5 years, and co-occurred with symptoms of conduct disorder, depression, anxiety, and psychosis. Exposure to harsh treatment in the family environment through age 10 years predicted borderline personality related characteristics at age 12 years. This association showed evidence of environmental mediation and was stronger among children with a family history of psychiatric illness, consistent with diathesis–stress models of borderline etiology. Results indicate that borderline personality related characteristics in children share etiological features with borderline personality disorder in adults and suggest that inherited and environmental risk factors make independent and interactive contributions to borderline etiology.},

BACKGROUND: The American Medical Association Masterfile data on physician and surgeon location, characteristics and specialty; Census derived sociodemographic data from 2006 ZIP code level Claritas PopFacts database; and Medicare per beneficiary costs from the Dartmouth Atlas of Health Care project.
METHODS: A correlational analysis using bivariate plots and fixed effects linear regression models controlling for hospital service area sociodemographics and the number and characteristics of the physician supply. Data were aggregated to the Dartmouth hospital service area level from ZIP code level files.
RESULTS: We found that costs are strongly related to the sociodemographic character of the hospital service areas and the overall supply of physicians but a mixed correlation to the specialist supply depending on the interaction of the proportion of the physician supply who are international medical graduates. The ratio of general surgeons and surgical subspecialists to population are associated with lower costs in the models, again with difference depending on the influence of international medical graduates. There is a strong association between higher costs and the local proportion of physician supply made up of graduates of non-US or Canadian medical schools and female graduates.
CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that strategies to reduce overall costs by changing physician supply must consider more than just overall numbers.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Heavy drinking in early adulthood among Blacks, but not Whites, has been found to be associated with more deleterious health outcomes, lower labor market success and lower educational attainment at mid-life. This study analysed psychosocial pathways underlying racial differences in the impact of early heavy alcohol use on occupational and educational attainment at mid-life.
METHODS: Outcomes in labor market participation, occupational prestige and educational attainment were measured in early and mid-adulthood. A mixture model was used to identify psychosocial classes that explain how race-specific differences in the relationship between drinking in early adulthood and occupational outcomes in mid-life operate. Data came from Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults, a longitudinal epidemiologic study.
RESULTS: Especially for Blacks, heavy drinking in early adulthood was associated with a lower probability of being employed in mid-life. Among employed persons, there was a link between heavy drinking for both Whites and Blacks and decreased occupational attainment at mid-life. We grouped individuals into three distinct distress classes based on external stressors and indicators of internally generated stress. Blacks were more likely to belong to the higher distressed classes as were heavy drinkers in early adulthood. Stratifying the data by distress class, relationships between heavy drinking, race and heavy drinking-race interactions were overall weaker than in the pooled analysis.
CONCLUSIONS: Disproportionate intensification of life stresses in Blacks renders them more vulnerable to long-term effects of heavy drinking.},

Food-insecure children had lower IQs and higher levels of behavioral and emotional problems relative to their peers. After differences in household income, the personalities of children's mothers, and the sensitivity of household organization to children's needs were accounted for, food-insecure children had moderately higher levels of emotional problems relative to food-secure children (β = 0.22, P = 0.02). Differences in children's cognitive development were accounted for by household income, and differences in their behavioral development were accounted for by their mothers’ personalities and their households’ sensitivity to children's needs. Results suggest that food insecurity was associated with school-aged children's emotional problems but not with their cognitive or behavioral problems after accounting for differences in the home environments in which children were reared.

	abstract = {Projected nursing shortfalls have spurred the state of North Carolina to initiate a series of strategies to increase the number of graduates from pre-licensure Registered Nurse (RN) programs. These efforts have been largely successful, but attrition rates from Associate Degree Nursing (ADN) programs remain high. Only 58\% of students entering ADN programs complete the degree. While policy makers are keenly aware that attrition from ADN programs is problematic, there is a lack of empirical evidence to identify the specific factors contributing to student attrition. In late 2007, the North Carolina Community College System (NCCCS) asked the Cecil G. Sheps Center for Health Services Research to conduct a study of Associate Degree Nursing program attrition and its causes. This paper summarizes the findings from that study and identifies the student- and program-level characteristics associated with more and less successful ADN programs. While this study was conducted in a single state in the US, the substantive findings--as well as the methodological approach--may be useful to other states and other countries. The study revealed that socioeconomically disadvantaged students (those with GEDs and those who received Pell Grants), non-white students, and younger and older students were less likely to graduate on-time. When programs were grouped into high and low performance categories on the basis of risk adjusted graduation rates, high performing programs were distinguished by more stringent admissions policies and better educated faculties. Nursing shortages have garnered significant attention and resources from state and national workforce planners in recent years. But to date, investments in expanding program capacity have not been matched by attention to program completion rates, with the result that we have enlarged the pipeline without fixing the leaks. Faculty shortages and recession-induced resource constraints limit further program expansion. Addressing attrition problems can expand RN production in the short-term at relatively lower costs.},

METHODS: We performed a longitudinal analysis of nationally representative Medicare data, the Medicare 5\% sample, collected from January 1, 1991, through December 31, 2004, using standard claims data algorithms and cross-sectional analysis of the Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey.
RESULTS: Compared with Medicare beneficiaries first diagnosed with diabetes mellitus in 1994, those first diagnosed with diabetes in 1999 and in 2003 showed lower rates of background and proliferative diabetic retinopathy within 1 year after diagnosis and during 6 years of follow-up among the 1999 cohort. Six-year rates of surgical procedures for retinopathy were lower among beneficiaries in the 1999 cohort than in the 1994 cohort, and rates of glucose, lipid, and cholesterol monitoring were higher. In addition, hypertension was diagnosed more frequently among the 1999 cohort during 6 years. Data from the Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey showed higher rates of antihypertensive drug use among persons diagnosed with diabetes in 1999 compared with 1994.
CONCLUSIONS: Decreases in rates of diabetic retinopathy among persons newly diagnosed with diabetes enrolled in Medicare from 1994 to 2004 and concurrent improvements in primary care for diabetes suggest that better primary care has had an effect on the Medicare population, despite increasing rates of other adverse outcomes.},

To estimate the prevalence of major eye diseases and low vision or blindness in a national sample of male US Union Army veterans from 1890 to 1910 and to compare these prevalence rates with contemporary rates for the same diseases and visual status.

Design
Longitudinal histories of 16 022 white Union Army veterans receiving disability pensions from 1890 to 1910 were developed from pension board examination records. Prevalence rates of trachoma, corneal opacities, cataract, diseases of the retina and optic nerve, and low vision or blindness were calculated in 1895 and 1910. Changes in prevalence by age were examined.

Results
By 1910, 11.9\% of veterans had low vision or were blind in both eyes. Prevalence of cataract increased with age, resulting in 13.1\% of veterans having had cataract in one or both eyes. Rates of trachoma were 3.2\% in 1895 and 4.8\% in 1910. Rates of corneal opacity were 3.0\% and 5.1\%, respectively. Glaucoma was rarely diagnosed from 1890 to 1910, but diseases of the optic nerve were reported in 2.0\% of veterans in 1895 and 3.6\% in 1910.

Conclusions
This study documents substantial reductions in the prevalence of low vision or blindness and changes in the composition of eye diseases from an era in which there were few effective therapies for eye diseases to the present.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: To determine longitudinal rates of postoperative adverse outcomes after incisional glaucoma surgery in a nationally representative longitudinal sample.
DESIGN: Retrospective, longitudinal cohort analysis.
PARTICIPANTS: Medicare beneficiaries {\textgreater}or=68 years who underwent a primary trabeculectomy (PT), trabeculectomy with scarring (TS), or glaucoma drainage device (GDD) implantation from 1994 to 2003 with follow-up through 2005.
INTERVENTION: Primary trabeculectomy, TS, and GDD were identified from International Classification of Diseases (ICD-9-CM) and Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) procedure codes. Change in rates of postoperative adverse outcomes associated with these 3 surgical interventions was analyzed by cumulative incidence rates and Cox proportional hazards model regression; regression analysis controlled for prior adverse outcome measures (3-year run-up) and demographic variables.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: First-, second-, and sixth-year cumulative rates and probability of experiencing serious adverse outcomes (retinal detachment, endophthalmitis, suprachoroidal hemorrhage), less serious adverse outcomes (choroidal detachment, corneal edema, hypotony), and receipt of additional glaucoma surgery were identified through Medicare claims for each treatment group.
RESULTS: At the 1-year follow-up, rates of severe adverse outcomes were higher among beneficiaries in the GDD group (2.0\%) relative to the PT (0.6\%) and TS groups (1.3\%). Controlling for prior adverse outcomes to the surgery and demographic factors in Cox proportional analysis, differences were often reduced, but generally remained statistically and clinically significant. Rates of severe outcomes, less severe outcomes, corneal edema, and low vision/blindness were higher for persons undergoing GDD than PT or TS. However, rates of reoperation were higher for TS than GDD.
CONCLUSIONS: The risk for adverse outcomes was higher in GDD than in PT surgery or TS, controlling for a number of important case mix and demographic factors.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Research with college populations suggests that elevated levels of heavy drinking do not generally persist into later adulthood for most individuals. The aims of this study were to determine whether this pattern applies to the population as a whole and to identify those for whom heavy drinking in early adulthood does lead to continued high levels of consumption throughout the life course.
METHOD: Patterns of heavy drinking were assessed, and a mixture model was used to evaluate relationships between psychological profiles and trajectories of heavy drinking in early to middle adulthood for race-gender groups. Subjects (N = 5,115; 55\% women) were drawn from the longitudinal study of Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) conducted in four major U.S. cities from 1985 to 1995.
RESULTS: Patterns of heavy drinking differed by race and gender, with higher rates observed among whites and men. Heavy drinking was generally most common in the early 20s and dropped sharply thereafter. For a subset with psychological profiles characterized by elevated levels of hostility, anxiety, and depressive symptoms, high rates of heavy drinking persisted into later adulthood; 20\% of whites and 50\% of blacks in the overall sample were in this subset. Rates of heavy drinking in this group were similar for blacks and whites.
CONCLUSIONS: At a population level, heavy drinking in early adulthood tends not to continue into later life. For a subset of psychologically vulnerable individuals, however, early adult heavy drinking persists into the middle adulthood years.},

	abstract = {Using a comprehensive database constructed from the pension files of US Civil War veterans, we explore characteristics and occurrence of type 2 diabetes among older black and white males, living circa 1900. We find that rates of diagnosed diabetes were much lower among males in this period than a century later. In contrast to the late 20th Century, the rates of diagnosed diabetes were lower among black than among white males, suggesting that the reverse pattern is of relatively recent origin. Two-thirds of both white and black veterans had body-mass indexes (BMIs) in the currently recommended weight range, a far higher proportion than documented by recent surveys. Longevity among persons with diabetes was not reduced among Civil War veterans, and those with diabetes suffered comparatively few sequelae of the condition. Over 90\% of black veterans engaged in low paying, high-physical effort jobs, as compared to about half of white veterans. High rates of work-related physical activity may provide a partial explanation of low rates of diagnosed diabetes among blacks. We found no evidence of discrimination in testing by race, as indicated by rates of examinations in which a urinalysis was performed. This dataset is valuable for providing a national benchmark against which to compare modern diabetes prevalence patterns.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The natural history of type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) in the elderly has not been previously described in a national longitudinal sample.
METHODS: This national longitudinal analysis (January 1, 1991, to December 31, 2004) examines mortality and morbidity rates in a representative sample of elderly patients newly diagnosed as having DM. Medicare beneficiaries diagnosed as having DM in 1994 (n=33,772) were compared with a control group (n=25,563) regarding death, lower extremity complications, nephropathy, retinopathy, cardiovascular complications, and cerebrovascular complications.
RESULTS: The DM group had excess mortality of 9.2\% by year 11 compared with the control group. By 2004, 91.8\% of the DM group experienced an adverse complication compared with 72.0\% of the control group. The DM group had a higher prevalence and incidence of microvascular and macrovascular complications at all time points compared with controls. Patients with DM were at increased risk for all lower extremity complications, particularly those requiring surgical intervention (gangrene, debridement, and amputation). Cardiovascular complications were a leading cause of morbidity, with 57.6\% of the DM group diagnosed as having heart failure compared with 34.1\% of the controls.
CONCLUSION: Elderly persons newly diagnosed as having DM experienced high rates of complications during 10-year follow-up, far in excess of elderly persons without this diagnosis, implying a substantial burden on the individual and on the health care system.},

DESIGN: A retrospective cohort study to estimate program payments per capita and in total for each of the major eye diseases and the four eye diseases in total.
METHODS: Data from the 1994 and 1999 National Long-Term Care Survey (NLTCS) and medical claims to Medicare from 1991 to 2000 were merged with the NLTCS. Medicare payments for eye-related procedures on persons with and without major eye diseases as reported on Medicare claims and self-reported data from NLTCS.
RESULTS: Overall, the burden of major eye diseases was to increase Medicare spending by 4.8 billion dollars (1999 USD) in 1991 to 1995 and by 4.5 billion dollars in 1996 to 2000. The most expensive eye disease was cataract, costing Medicare 3.8 billion dollars in 1991 to 1995 and 3 billion dollars in 1996 to 2000.
CONCLUSIONS: Prevalence of major eye diseases increased over time, but the effect of major eye diseases on Medicare payments decreased, mainly as a result of lower payments for cataract surgery in the later years.},

	abstract = {Significance
            The global population is aging, driving up age-related disease morbidity. Antiaging interventions are needed to reduce the burden of disease and protect population productivity. Young people are the most attractive targets for therapies to extend healthspan (because it is still possible to prevent disease in the young). However, there is skepticism about whether aging processes can be detected in young adults who do not yet have chronic diseases. Our findings indicate that aging processes can be quantified in people still young enough for prevention of age-related disease, opening a new door for antiaging therapies. The science of healthspan extension may be focused on the wrong end of the lifespan; rather than only studying old humans, geroscience should also study the young.
          , 
            Antiaging therapies show promise in model organism research. Translation to humans is needed to address the challenges of an aging global population. Interventions to slow human aging will need to be applied to still-young individuals. However, most human aging research examines older adults, many with chronic disease. As a result, little is known about aging in young humans. We studied aging in 954 young humans, the Dunedin Study birth cohort, tracking multiple biomarkers across three time points spanning their third and fourth decades of life. We developed and validated two methods by which aging can be measured in young adults, one cross-sectional and one longitudinal. Our longitudinal measure allows quantification of the pace of coordinated physiological deterioration across multiple organ systems (e.g., pulmonary, periodontal, cardiovascular, renal, hepatic, and immune function). We applied these methods to assess biological aging in young humans who had not yet developed age-related diseases. Young individuals of the same chronological age varied in their “biological aging” (declining integrity of multiple organ systems). Already, before midlife, individuals who were aging more rapidly were less physically able, showed cognitive decline and brain aging, self-reported worse health, and looked older. Measured biological aging in young adults can be used to identify causes of aging and evaluate rejuvenation therapies.},
